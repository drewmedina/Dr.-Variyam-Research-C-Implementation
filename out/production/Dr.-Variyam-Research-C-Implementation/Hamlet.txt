a
piece
of
him
welcome
what
i
have
seen
nothing
horatio
says
tis
but
our
fantasy
and
will
not
let
belief
take
hold
of
him
touching
this
dreaded
sight
therefore
i
have
entreated
him
along
with
us
to
watch
the
minutes
of
this
night
that
if
again
this
apparition
come
he
may
approve
our
eyes
and
speak
to
it
tush
sit
down
awhile
and
let
us
once
again
assail
your
ears
that
are
so
fortified
against
our
story
what
we
have
two
nights
seen
well
and
let
us
hear
bernardo
speak
of
this
last
night
of
all
when
yond
same
star
thats
westward
from
the
pole
had
made
his
course
to
illume
that
part
of
heaven
where
now
it
burns
the
bell
then
beating
one
enter
ghost
peace
in
the
same
figure
thou
art
a
scholar
looks
it
not
like
the
king
mark
it
most
like
it
harrows
me
with
fear
and
wonder
it
would
be
spoke
to
question
it
what
art
thou
that
usurpst
this
time
of
night
together
with
that
fair
and
warlike
form
in
which
the
majesty
of
buried
denmark
did
sometimes
march
by
heaven
i
charge
thee
it
is
offended
see
stay
speak
exit
ghost
tis
gone
how
now
is
not
this
something
more
than
fantasy
what
think
you
ont
before
my
god
without
the
sensible
and
true
avouch
of
mine
own
eyes
is
it
not
like
the
king
as
thou
art
to
thyself
such
was
the
very
armour
he
had
on
when
he
the
ambitious
norway
combated
so
frownd
he
once
he
smote
the
sledded
polacks
on
the
ice
tis
strange
thus
twice
before
with
martial
stalk
hath
he
gone
by
our
watch
in
what
particular
thought
to
work
i
know
not
but
in
the
gross
and
scope
of
my
opinion
this
bodes
some
strange
eruption
to
our
state
good
now
why
this
same
strict
and
most
observant
watch
so
nightly
toils
the
subject
of
the
land
and
why
such
daily
cast
of
brazen
cannon
and
foreign
mart
for
implements
of
war
why
such
impress
of
shipwrights
does
not
divide
the
sunday
from
the
week
what
might
be
toward
doth
make
the
night
joint
labourer
with
the
day
who
ist
that
can
inform
me
that
can
i
at
least
whose
image
even
but
now
appeard
to
us
was
thereto
prickd
on
by
a
most
emulate
pride
dared
to
the
combat
for
so
this
side
of
our
known
world
esteemd
him
did
slay
this
fortinbras
well
ratified
by
law
and
heraldry
did
forfeit
which
he
stood
seized
of
against
the
which
was
gaged
by
our
king
to
the
inheritance
of
fortinbras
had
he
been
vanquisher
and
carriage
of
the
article
designed
his
fell
to
hamlet
now
of
unimproved
mettle
hot
and
full
hath
in
the
skirts
of
norway
here
and
there
sharkd
up
a
list
of
lawless
resolutes
for
food
and
diet
that
hath
a
stomach
int
as
it
doth
well
appear
unto
our
state
but
to
recover
of
us
and
terms
compulsatory
so
by
his
father
lost
and
this
is
the
main
motive
of
our
preparations
the
source
of
this
our
watch
and
the
chief
head
of
this
posthaste
and
romage
in
the
land
i
think
it
be
no
other
but
een
so
well
may
it
sort
that
this
portentous
figure
comes
armed
through
our
watch
that
was
and
is
the
question
of
these
wars
a
mote
it
is
to
trouble
the
minds
eye
in
the
most
high
and
palmy
state
of
rome
a
little
ere
the
mightiest
julius
fell
the
graves
stood
tenantless
and
the
sheeted
dead
did
squeak
and
gibber
in
the
roman
streets
as
stars
with
trains
of
fire
and
dews
of

our
hearts
in
grief
and
our
whole
kingdom
to
be
contracted
in
one
brow
of
woe
yet
so
far
hath
discretion
fought
with
nature
that
we
with

sorrow
think
on
him
together
with
remembrance
of
ourselves
therefore
our
sometime
sister
the
imperial
jointress
to
this
warlike
state
have
we
with
an
auspicious
and
a
dropping
eye
with
mirth
in
funeral
and
with
dirge
in

in

weighing

to
pester
us
with
message
importing
the
surrender
of
those
lands
lost
by
his
father
to
our
most
valiant
brother
so
much
for
him
now
for
ourself
and
for
this
time
of
meeting
thus
much
the
business
is
we
have
here
writ
to

giving
to
you
no
further
personal
power
to
business
with
the
king
of

allow
farewell
in
that
and
all
things
will
we
show
our
duty
we
doubt
it
nothing
heartily
farewell
exeunt
voltimand
and
cornelius
and
now
you
told
us
of
some
suit
you
cannot
speak
of
reason
to
the
dane
and
loose
your
voice
what
wouldst
thou
beg
that
shall
not
be
my
offer
the
head
is
not
more
native
to
the
heart
the
hand
more
instrumental
to
the
mouth
than
is
the
throne
of
denmark
to
thy
father
what
wouldst
thou
have
my
dread
lord
your
leave
and
favour
to
return
to
france
from
whence
though
willingly
i
came
to
denmark
to
show
my
duty
in
your
coronation
yet
now
my
thoughts
and
wishes
bend
again
toward
france
and
bow
them
to
your
gracious
leave
and
pardon
have
you
your
fathers
leave
what
says
polonius
he
hath
by
laboursome
petition
upon
his
will
i
seald
my
hard
consent
i
do
beseech
you
take
thy
fair
hour
and
thy
best
graces
spend
it
at
thy
will
but
now
aside
a
little
more
than
kin
how
is
it
that
the
clouds
still
hang
on
you
not
so
good
hamlet
and
let
thine
eye
look
like
a
friend
on
denmark
do
not
for
ever
with
thy
vailed
lids
seek
for
thy
noble
father
in
the
dust
thou
knowst
tis
common
passing
through
nature
to
eternity
ay
if
it
be
why
seems
it
so
particular
with
thee
seems
tis
not
alone
my
inky
cloak
nor
customary
suits
of
solemn
black
nor
windy
suspiration
of
forced
breath
no
nor
the
dejected
havior
of
the
visage
together
with
all
forms
that
can
denote
me
truly
these
indeed
seem
for
they
are
actions
that
a
man
might
play
but
i
have
that
within
which
passeth
show
these
but
the
trappings
and
the
suits
of
woe
tis
sweet
and
commendable
in
your
nature
to
give
these
mourning
duties
to
your
father
but
that
father
lost
in
filial
obligation
for
some
term
to
do
obsequious
sorrow
but
to
persever
in
obstinate
condolement
is
a
course
of
impious
stubbornness
it
shows
a
will
most
incorrect
to
heaven
a
heart
unfortified
an
understanding
simple
and
unschoold
for
what
we
know
must
be
and
is
as
common
as
any
the
most
vulgar
thing
to
sense
why
should
we
in
our
peevish
opposition
take
it
to
heart
fie
tis
a
fault
to
heaven
a
fault
against
the
dead
to
reason
most
absurd
whose
common
theme
is
death
of
fathers
from
the
first
corse
till
he
that
died
today
this
must
be
so
we
pray
you
this
unprevailing
woe
as
of
a
father
for
let
the
world
take
note
you
are
the
most
immediate
to
our
throne
and
with
no
less
nobility
of
love
than
that
which
dearest
father
bears
his
son
do
i
impart
toward
you
for
your
intent
in
going
back
to
school
in
wittenberg
it
is
most
retrograde
to
our
desire
and
we
beseech
you
here
our
chiefest
courtier
let
not
thy
mother
lose
her
prayers
i
pray
thee
i
shall
in
all
my
best
obey
you
why
be
as
ourself
in
denmark
madam
this
gentle
and
unforced
accord
of
hamlet
sits
smiling
to
my
heart
in
grace
whereof
no
jocund
health
that
denmark
drinks
today
but
the
great
cannon
to
the
clouds
shall
tell
and
the
kings
rouse
the
heavens
all
bruit
again
respeaking

thunder
come
away
exeunt

resolve
itself
into

everlasting

not
fixd

how
weary

me
not

you
from

my
good
lord
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
good
even
but
what
a
truant
disposition
i
would
not
hear
your
enemy
say
so
nor
shall
you
do
mine
ear
that
violence
to
make
it
truster
of
your
own
report
against
yourself
i
know
you
are
no
truant
but
what
is
your
affair
in
elsinore
well
teach
you
to
drink
deep
ere
you
depart
my
lord
i
pray
thee
i
think
it
was
to
see
my
mothers
wedding
indeed
thrift
did
coldly
furnish
forth
the
marriage
tables
would
i
had
met
my
dearest
foe
in
heaven
or
ever
i
had
seen
that
day
my
fathermethinks
i
see
my
father
where
in
my
minds
eye
i
saw
him
once
he
was
a
man
i
shall
not
look
upon
his
like
again
my
lord
saw
who
my
lord
the
king
my
father
season
your
admiration
for
awhile
with
an
attent
ear
upon
the
witness
of
these
gentlemen
this
marvel
to
you
for
gods
love
two
nights
together
had
these
gentlemen
marcellus
and
bernardo
in
the
dead
vast
and
middle
of
the
night
been
thus
encounterd
a
figure
like
your
father
armed
at
point
exactly
appears
before
them
goes
slow
and
stately
by
them
thrice
he
walked
by
their
oppressd
and
fear
surprised
eyes
within
his
truncheons
length
almost
to
jelly
with
the
act
of
fear
stand
dumb
and
speak
not
to
him
this
to
me
in
dreadful
secrecy
impart
they
did
and
i
with
them
the
third
night
kept
the
watch
where
form
of
the
thing
the
apparition
comes
i
knew
your
father
these
hands
are
not
more
like
but
where
was
this
my
lord
did
you
not
speak
to
it
my
lord
but
answer
made
it
none
yet
once
methought
it
lifted
up
its
head
and
did
address
itself
to
motion
but
even
then
the
morning
cock
crew
loud
and
at
the
sound
it
shrunk
in
haste
away
and
vanishd
from
our
sight
tis
very
strange
as
i
do
live
and
we
did
think
it
writ
down
in
our
duty
to
let
you
know
of
it
indeed
hold
you
the
watch
tonight
we
do
armd
armd
from
top
to
toe
my
lord
then
saw
you
not
his
face
o
what
a
countenance
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
pale
or
red
nay
and
fixd
his
eyes
upon
you
most
constantly
i
would
i
had
been
there
it
would
have
much
amazed
you
very
like
while
one
with
moderate
haste
might
tell
a
hundred
longer
not
when
i
sawt
his
beard
was
grizzledno
it
was
a
sable
silverd
i
will
watch
tonight
perchance
twill
walk
again
i
warrant
it
will
if
it
assume
my
noble
fathers
person
ill
speak
to
it
and
bid
me
hold
my
peace
i
pray
you
all
if
you
have
hitherto
conceald
this
sight
let
it
be
tenable
in
your
silence
still
and
whatsoever
else
shall
hap
tonight
give
it
an
understanding
i
will
requite
your
loves
so
upon
the
platform
ill
visit
you
our
duty
to
your
honour
your
loves
exeunt
all
but
hamlet
my
fathers
spirit
in
arms
all
is
not
well
i
doubt
some
foul
play
would
the
night
were
come
till
then
sit
still
though
all
the
earth
oerwhelm
them
exit

let
me
hear
from
you
do
you
doubt

the

of
his
favour
hold
it

it
no

bulk
the
inward
service
of
the
mind
and
soul
grows
wide
withal
perhaps
he
loves
you
now
and
now
no
soil
nor
cautel
doth
besmirch
the
virtue
of
his
will
but
you
must
fear
his
greatness
weighd
for
he
himself
is
subject
to
his
birth
he
may
not
carve
for
himself
the
safety
and
health
of
this
whole
state
and
therefore
must
his
choice
be
circumscribed
unto
the
voice
and
yielding
of
that
body
whereof
he
is
the
head
then
if
he
says
he
loves
you
it
fits
your
wisdom
so
far
to
believe
it
as
he
in
his
particular
act
and
place
may
give
his
saying
deed
than
the
main
voice
of
denmark
goes
withal
then
weigh
what
loss
your
honour
may
sustain
if
with
too
credent
ear
you
list
his
songs
or
lose
your
heart
to
his
unmasterd
importunity
fear
it
and
keep
you
in
the
rear
of
your
affection
out
of
the
shot
and
danger
of
desire
the
chariest
maid
is
prodigal
enough
if
she
unmask
her
beauty
to
the
moon
virtue
itself
scapes
not
calumnious
strokes
the
canker
galls
the
infants
of
the
spring
too
oft
before
their
buttons
be
disclosed
and
in
the
morn
and
liquid
dew
of
youth
contagious

are
most
imminent
be
wary
then
youth
to
itself

i
shall
the
effect
of
this
good
lesson
keep
as
watchman
to
my
heart
but
do
not
show
me
the
steep
and
thorny
way
to
heaven
whiles
himself
the
primrose
path
of
dalliance
treads

recks
not

to
you
have
of
your

been
most
free
and
bounteous
if
it
be
so
and
that
in
way
of
caution
you
do
not
understand
yourself
so
clearly
as
it
behoves
my
daughter
and
your
honour
what
is
between
you
give
me
up
the
truth
he
hath
of
his
affection
to

pooh
you
speak
like
a
green
girl
unsifted
in
such
perilous
circumstance
do
you
believe
his
tenders
i
do
not
know
marry
that
you
have
taen
these
tenders
for
true

which
are
not
sterling
tender
yourself
more
dearly

the

of
the
poor
phrase
running
it
thusyoull
tender
me
a
fool
my
lord
in
honourable
fashion
ay
and
hath
given
countenance
to
his
speech
with
almost
all
the
holy
vows
of
heaven
ay
when
the
blood
burns
lends
the
tongue
vows
these
blazes
giving
more
light
than
heat
even
in
their
promise
you
must
not
take
for
fire
from
this
time
be
somewhat
scanter
of
your
maiden
presence
set
your
entreatments
at
a
higher
rate
than
a
command
to
parley
for
lord
hamlet
believe
so
much
in
him
and
with
a
larger
tether
may
he
walk
than
may
be
given
you
in
few
do
not
believe
his
vows
not
of
that
dye
which
their
investments
show
but
mere
implorators
of
unholy
suits
breathing
like
sanctified
and
pious
bawds
the
better
to
beguile
this
is
for
all
i
would
not
have
you
so
slander
any
moment
leisure
as
to
give
words
or
talk
with
the
lord

look
tot
i

obey
exeunt

iv
the

the
air
bites
shrewdly
it
is
a
nipping
and
an
eager
air
what
hour
now
i
think
it
lacks
of
twelve
no
indeed
i
heard
it
not
then
it
draws
near
the
season
wherein
the
spirit
held
his
wont
to
walk
a
flourish
of
trumpets
what
does
this

the

doth
wake
tonight
and
takes
his
rouse
keeps
wassail
and
the
kettledrum

thus
bray
out
the
triumph
of

is
it
a
custom
ay
but
to
my
mind
and
to
the
manner
born
more
honourd
in
the

than
the

you
toward

and
there
assume
some

horrible

which
might
deprive
your

draw
you
into
madness

the
very
place

toys
of
desperation
without

that

many
fathoms
to

my
fate
cries

enter
ghost
and
hamlet
where
wilt
thou
lead
me
speak
mark
me
i
will
my
hour
is
almost
come
when
i
to
sulphurous
and
tormenting
flames
must
render
up
myself
alas
pity
me
not
to
what
i
shall
unfold
speak
so
art
thou
to
revenge
what
i
am
thy
fathers
spirit
doomd
for
a
certain
term
to
walk
the
night
and
for
the
day
confined
to
fast
in
fires
till
the
foul
crimes
done
in
my
days
of
nature
are
burnt
and
purged
away
but
that
i
am
forbid
to
tell
the
secrets
of
my
prisonhouse
i
could
a
tale
unfold
whose
lightest
word
would
harrow
up
thy
soul
make
thy
two
eyes
thy
knotted
and
combined
locks
to
part
and
each
particular
hair
to
stand
on
end
like
quills
upon
the
fretful
porpentine
but
this
eternal
blazon
must
not
be
to
ears
of
flesh
and
blood
list
if
thou
didst
ever
thy
dear
father
love
o
god
revenge
his
foul
and
most
unnatural
murder
murder
murder
most
foul
but
this
most
foul
haste
me
to
knowt
as
meditation
or
the
thoughts
of
love
may
sweep
to
my
revenge
i
find
thee
apt
and
duller
shouldst
thou
be
than
the
fat
weed
that
roots
itself
in
ease
on
lethe
wharf
wouldst
thou
not
stir
in
this
now
tis
given
out
that
a
serpent
stung
me
is
by
a
forged
process
of
my
death
rankly
abused
but
know
the
serpent
that
did
sting
thy
fathers
life
now
wears
his
crown
o
my
prophetic
soul
my
uncle
ay
with
witchcraft
of
his
wit
o
wicked
wit
and
gifts
so
to
seducewon
to
his
shameful
lust
the
will
of
my
most
seemingvirtuous
queen
o
hamlet
from
me
that
it
went
hand
in
hand
even
with
the
vow
i
made
to
her
in
marriage
upon
a
wretch
whose
natural
gifts
were
poor
to
those
of
mine
but
virtue
though
lewdness
court
it
in
a
shape
of
heaven
so
lust
will
sate
itself
in
a
celestial
bed
and
prey
on
garbage
but
brief
let
me
be
sleeping
within
my
orchard
my
custom
always
of
the
afternoon
upon
my
secure
hour
thy
uncle
stole
with
juice
of
cursed
hebenon
in
a
vial
and
in
the
porches
of
my
ears
did
pour
the
leperous
distilment
holds
such
an
enmity
with
blood
of
man
that
swift
as
quicksilver
it
courses
through
the
natural
gates
and
alleys
of
the
body
and
with
a
sudden
vigour
doth
posset
and
curd
the
thin
and
wholesome
blood
so
did
it
mine
and
a
most
instant
tetter
barkd
about
most
lazarlike
all
my
smooth
body
thus
was
i
of
life
cut
off
even
in
the
blossoms
of
my
sin
unhouseld
no
reckoning
made
with
all
my
imperfections
on
my
head
o
if
thou
hast
nature
in
thee
let
not
the
royal
bed
of
denmark
be
a
couch
for
luxury
and
damned
incest
but
taint
not
thy
mind
against
thy
mother
aught
leave
her
to
heaven
and
to
those
thorns
that
in
her
bosom
lodge
to
prick
and
sting
her

my
lord

my
lord
nor
i
upon
my

ah

cellarage

propose
the
oath
never
to
speak
of
this
that
you
have
seen
swear
by
my
sword
beneath
swear
hic
et
ubique
then
well
shift
our
ground
come
hither
and
lay
your
hands
again
upon
my
sword
never
to
speak
of
this
that
you
have
heard
swear
by
my
sword
beneath
swear
well
said
a
worthy
pioner
once
more
remove
o
day
and
night
and
therefore
as
a
stranger
give
it
welcome
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
are
dreamt
of
in
your
philosophy
but
come
here
how
strange
or
odd
soeer
i
bear
myself
as
i
perchance
hereafter
shall
think
meet
to
put
an
antic
disposition
on
that
you
with
arms
encumberd
thus
or
by
pronouncing
of
some
doubtful
phrase
as
well
or
if
we
list
to
speak
or
such
ambiguous
giving
out
that
you
know
aught
of
me
this
not
to
do
so
grace
and
mercy
at
your
most
need
help
you
beneath
swear
rest
they
swear
so
with
all
my
love
i
do
commend
me
to
you
and
what
so
poor
a
man
as
hamlet
is
may
do
god
willing
and
still
your
fingers
on
your
lips
the
time
is
out
of
joint
o
cursed
spite
that
ever
i
was
born
to
set
it
right
nay
exeunt
act
ii
scene
i
a
room
in
polonius
house
enter
polonius
and
reynaldo
give
him
this
money
and
these
notes
i
will
you
shall
do
marvellous
wisely
before
you
visit
him
of
his
behavior
my
lord
marry
inquire
me
first
what
danskers
are
in
paris
and
how
what
company
by
this
encompassment
and
drift
of
question
that
they
do
know
my
son
than
your
particular
demands
will
touch
it
take
you
as
thus
and
in
part
him
do
you
mark
this
ay
and
in
part
him
but
addicted
so
and
so
and
there
put
on
him
what
forgeries
you
please
as
may
dishonour
him
but
as
are
companions
noted
and
most
known
to
youth
and
liberty
as
gaming
ay
drabbing
you
may
go
so
far
my
lord
faith
you
must
not
put
another
scandal
on
him
that
he
is
open
to
incontinency
thats
not
my
meaning
but
breathe
his
faults
so
quaintly
that
they
may
seem
the
taints
of
liberty
the
flash
and
outbreak
of
a
fiery
mind
a
savageness
in
unreclaimed
blood
of
general
assault
but
wherefore
should
you
do
this
ay
i
would
know
that
marry
and
i
believe
you
laying
these
slight
sullies
on
my
son
as
twere
a
thing
a
little
soild
i
the
working
your
party
in
converse
having
ever
seen
in
the
prenominate
crimes
the
youth
you
breathe
of
guilty
he
closes
with
you
in
this
consequence
good
sir
according
to
the
phrase
or
the
addition
of
man
and
country
very
good
and
then
about
to
say
by
the
mass
something
where
did
i
leave
at
closes
in
the
consequence
and
gentleman
at
closes
in
the
consequence
he
closes
thus
i
know
the
gentleman
i
saw
him
yesterday
or
then
there
was
a
gaming
there
falling
out
at
tennis
or
perchance
i
saw
him
enter
such
a
house
of
sale
videlicet
see
you
now
your
bait
of
falsehood
takes
this

and
thus
do
we
of
wisdom
and
of
reach
with
windlasses
and
with
assays
of
bias
by
indirections
find
directions
out
so
by
my
former
lecture
and
advice
shall
you
my
son
you
have
me
my
lord
god
be
wi
you
good
my
lord
observe
his
inclination
in
yourself
i
shall
and
let
him
ply
his
music
well
farewell

enter
ophelia
how
now
o
with
what
my
lord
lord
hamlet
no
hat
upon
his
head
ungarterd
pale
as
his
shirt
and
with
a
look
so
piteous
in
purport
as
if
he
had
been
loosed
out
of
hell
to
speak
of
horrors
mad
for
thy
love
my
lord
but
truly
what
said
he
he
took
me
by
the
wrist
and
held
me
hard
then
goes
he
to
the
length
of
all
his
arm
and
he
falls
to
such
perusal
of
my
face
as
he
would
draw
it
long
stayd
he
so
at
last
and
thrice
his
head
thus
waving
up
and
down
he
raised
a
sigh
so
piteous
and
profound
as
it
did
seem
to
shatter
all
his
bulk
and
end
his
being
that
done
and
he
seemd
to
find
his
way
without
his
eyes
for
out
o
doors
he
went
without
their
helps
and
come
this
is
the
very
ecstasy
of
love
whose
violent
property
fordoes
itself
and
leads
the
will
to
desperate
undertakings
as
oft
as
any
passion
under
heaven
that
does
afflict
our
natures
i
am
sorry
what
no
i
did
repel
his
fetters
and
denied
his
access
to
me
that
hath
made
him
mad
i
am
sorry
that
with
better
heed
and
judgment
i
had
not
quoted
him
i
feard
he
did
but
trifle
and
meant
to
wreck
thee
by
heaven
to
cast
beyond
ourselves
in
our
opinions
as
it
is
common
for
the
younger
sort
to
lack
discretion
come
this
must
be
known
move
more
grief
to
hide
than
hate
to
utter
love

a
kings
remembrance
both
your
majesties
might
put
your
dread
pleasures
more
into
command
than
to

both
obey

who
hath
given

and
my

idol
beautified
ophelia
thats
an
ill
phrase
a
vile
phrase
but
you
shall
hear
thus
reads
in
her
excellent
white
bosom
came
this
from
hamlet
to
her
good
madam
reads
doubt
thou
the
stars
are
fire
doubt
that
the

to
be
a
liar
but
never

i
love
o
dear
ophelia
i
have
not
art
to
reckon
my
groans
but
that
i
love
thee
best
thine
evermore
most
dear
lady
this
machine
is
to
him
this
and
more
above
as
they
fell
out
by
time
all
given
to
mine
ear
but
how
hath
she
received
his
love
what
do
you
think
of
me
as
of
a
man
faithful
and
honourable
i
would
fain
prove
so
but
what
might
you
think
when
i
had
seen
this
hot
love
on
the
wing
as
i
perceived
it
before
my
daughter
told
mewhat
might
you
or
my
dear
majesty
your
queen
here
if
i
had
playd
the
desk
or
tablebook
or
given
my
heart
a
winking
or
lookd
upon
this
love
with
idle
sight
what
might
you
think
no
and
my
young
mistress
thus
i
did
bespeak
lord
hamlet
is
a
prince
this
must
not
be
and
then
i
precepts
gave
her
that
she
should
lock
herself
from
his
resort
admit
no
messengers
which
done
and
he
fell
into
a
sadness
thence
to
a
watch
thence
to
a
lightness
into
the
madness
wherein
now
he
raves
and
all
we
mourn
for
do
you
think
tis
this
it
may
be
hath
there
been
such
a
timeid
fain
know
that
that
i
have
positively
said
tis
so
when
it
proved
otherwise
not
that
i
know
pointing
to
his
head
and
shoulder
take
this
from
this
if
circumstances
lead
me
where
truth
is
hid
within
the
centre
how
may
we
try
it
further
you
know
here
in
the
lobby
so
he
does
indeed
at
such
a
time
ill
loose
my
daughter
to
him
be
you
and
i
behind
an
arras
then
mark
the
encounter
if
he
love
her
not
and
be
not
from
his
reason
falln
thereon
let
me
be
no
assistant
for
a
state
but
keep
a
farm
and
carters
we
will
try
it
but
away
ill

then
i
would
you
were
so
honest
a
man
honest
ay

picked
out
of
ten
thousand
thats
very
true
for
if
the
sun
breed
maggots
in
a
dead
dog
god
kissing
carrion
i
have
let
her
not
walk
i
the
sun
conception
is
a
blessing
but
not
as
your
daughter
may
conceive
friend
aside
how
say
you
by
that
still
harping
on
my
daughter
yet
he
knew
me
not
at
first
was
a
fishmonger
he
is
far
gone
truly
in
my
youth
i
suffered
much
extremity
for
love
what
do
you
read
words
what
is
the
matter
between
who
i
mean
slanders
that
old
men
have
grey
beards
wrinkled
plumtree
gum
and
that
they
have
a
plentiful
lack
of
wit
though
i
most
powerfully
and
potently
believe
i
hold
it
not
honesty
to
have
it
thus
set
down
yourself
you
could
go
backward
aside
though
this
be
madness
in
t
will
you
walk
out
of
the
air
into
my
grave
indeed
aside
how
pregnant
sometimes
his
replies
are
a
happiness
that
often
madness
hits
on
could
not
so
prosperously
be
delivered
of
i
will
leave
him
meeting
between
him

it

about
that
guilty
creatures
sitting
at
a
play
have
by
the
very
cunning
of
the
scene
been
struck
so
to
the
soul
that
presently
they
have
proclaimd
their
malefactions
for
murder
with
most
miraculous
organ
ill
have
these
players
play
something
like
the
murder
of
my
father
before
mine
uncle
ill
observe
his
looks
ill
tent
him
to
the
quick
if
he
but

the
devil
hath
power
to
assume
a
pleasing
shape
out
of
my
weakness
and
my
melancholy
as
he
is
very
potent
with
such
spirits
abuses
me
to
damn
me
ill
have
grounds
more
relative
than
this
the
play
s
the
thing
wherein
ill
catch
the
conscience
of
the
king
exit
act
iii
scene
i
a
room
in
the
castle
enter
king
claudius
and
can
you
get
from
him
why
he
puts
on
this
confusion
grating
so
harshly
all
his
days
of
quiet
with
turbulent
and
dangerous
lunacy
he
does
confess
he
feels
himself
distracted
but
from
what
cause
he
will
by
no
means
speak
nor
do
we
find
him
forward
to
be
sounded
but
when
we
would
bring
him
on
to
some
confession
of
his
true
state
did
he
receive
you
well
most
like
a
gentleman
but
with
much
forcing
of
his
disposition
niggard
of
question
most
free
in
his
reply
did
you
assay
him
to
any
pastime
madam
we
oerraught
on
the
way
of
these
we
told
him
and
there
did
seem
in
him
a
kind
of
joy
to
hear
of
it
they
are
about
the
court
and
this
night
to
play
before
him
tis
most
true
and
he
beseechd
me
to
entreat
your
majesties
to
hear
and
see
the
matter
with
all
my
heart
to
hear
him
so
inclined
good
gentlemen
and
drive
his
purpose
on
to
these
delights
we
shall
exeunt
rosencrantz
and
guildenstern
sweet
gertrude
for
we
have
closely
sent
for
hamlet
hither
that
he
affront
ophelia
her
father
and
myself
will
so
bestow
ourselves
that
we
may
of
their
encounter
frankly
judge
and
gather
by
him

be
the
affliction
of
his
love

he
suffers
for
i
shall
obey
you

for
your
part

colour
your
loneliness
we
are
oft
to
blame
in
this
tis
too
much
provedthat
with
devotions

and
pious
action
we
do

oer
the

o
how
smart
a
lash
that
speech
doth
give
my
conscience
the
harlots

is
not
more
ugly
to
the
thing
that
helps
it
than
is
my
deed
to
my
most
painted
word
o
heavy
burthen
i
hear
him
coming
lets
withdraw
exeunt
king
claudius
and
polonius
enter
hamlet
to
be
whether
tis
nobler
in
the
mind
to
suffer
the
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
or
to
take
arms
against
a
sea
of
troubles
and
by
opposing
end
them
to
die
to
sleep
no
more
the
heartache
and
the
thousand
natural
shocks
that
flesh
is
heir
to
devoutly
to
be
wishd
to
die
to
sleep
perchance
to
dream
ay
for
in
that
sleep
of
death
what
dreams
may
come
when
we
have
shuffled
off
this
mortal
coil
must
give
us
pause
theres
the
respect
that
makes
calamity
of
so
long
life
for
who
would
bear
the
whips
and
scorns
of
time
the
oppressors
wrong
the
pangs
of
despised
love
the
insolence
of
office
and
the
spurns
that
patient
merit
of
the
unworthy
takes
when
he
himself
might
his
quietus
make
with
a
bare
bodkin
who
would
fardels
bear
to
grunt
and
sweat
under
a
weary
life
but
that
the
dread
of
something
after
death
the
undiscoverd
country
from
whose
bourn
no
traveller
returns
and
makes
us
rather
bear
those
ills
we
have
than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
thus
conscience
does
make
cowards
of
us
all
and
thus
the
native
hue
of
resolution
is
sicklied
oer
with
the
pale
cast
of
thought
and
enterprises
of
great
pith
and
moment
with
this
regard
their
currents
turn
awry
and
lose
the
name
of
actionsoft
you
now
the
fair
ophelia
nymph
be
all
my
sins
rememberd
good
my
lord
how
does
your
honour
for
this
many
a
day
i
humbly
thank
you
my
lord
that
i
have
longed
long
to
redeliver
i
pray
you
no
i
never
gave
you
aught
my
honourd
lord
and
as
made
the
things
more
rich
their
perfume
lost
take
these
again
rich
gifts
wax
poor
when
givers
prove
unkind
there
ha
my
lord
are
you
fair
what
means
your
lordship
that
if
you
be
honest
and
fair
admit
no
discourse
to
your
beauty
could
beauty
with
honesty
ay
transform
honesty
from
what
it
is
to
a
bawd
than
the
force
of
honesty
can
translate
beauty
into
his
likeness
this
was
sometime
a
paradox
time
gives
it
proof
i
did
love
you
once
indeed
you
should
not
have
believed
me
so
inoculate
our
old
stock
but
we
shall
relish
of
it
i
loved
you
not
i
was
the
more
deceived
get
thee
to
a
nunnery
why
wouldst
thou
be
a
breeder
of
sinners
i
am
myself
indifferent
honest
but
yet
i
could
accuse
me
of
such
things
that
it
were
better
my
mother
had
not
borne
me
i
am
very
proud
my
beck
than
i
have
thoughts
to
put
them
in
imagination
to
give
them
shape
in
what
should
such
fellows
as
i
do
crawling
between
earth
and
heaven
we
are
arrant
knaves

o
the

the
expectancy
and
rose
of
the

the

of

and
the
mould
of

the
observed
of
all
observers
and
i
that
suckd
the
honey
of
his

vows
now
see
that
noble
and
most
sovereign
reason
like
sweet
bells
jangled
that
unmatchd
form
and
feature
of
blown
youth
blasted
with
ecstasy
o
to
have
seen
what
i
have
seen
reenter
king
claudius
and
polonius
love
his
affections
do
not
that
way
tend
nor
what
he
spake
was
not
like
madness
theres
something
in
his
soul
oer
which
his
melancholy
sits
on
brood
and
i
do
doubt
the
hatch
and
the
disclose
will
be
some
danger
which
for
to
prevent
i
have
in
quick
determination
thus
set
it
down
he
shall
with

for
the

neglected
tribute
haply
the

with

objects
shall
expel

in

whereon
his

still
beating
puts
him
thus
from
fashion
of
himself
what
think
you
ont
it
shall
do
well
but
yet
do
i
believe
the
origin
and
commencement
of
his
grief
sprung
from
neglected
love
how
now
you
need
not
tell
us
what
lord
hamlet
said
we
heard
it
all
my
lord
but
let
his
queen
mother
all
alone
entreat
him
to
show
his
grief
let
her
be
round
with
him
and
ill
be
placed
of
all
their
conference
if
she
find
him
not
to

gone

thirty

sheen
about

have
times
twelve
thirties
been
since
love
our
hearts
and
hymen
did
our
hands
unite
commutual
in
most
sacred
bands
so
many
journeys
may
the
sun
and
moon
make
us
again
count
oer
ere
love
be
done
but
so
far
from
cheer
and
from
your
former
state
that
i
distrust
you
yet
discomfort
you
for
womens
fear
and
love
holds
quantity
in
neither
aught
now
and
as
my
love
is
sized
where
love
is
great
where
little
fears
grow
great
faith
my
operant
powers
their
functions
leave
to
do
and
thou
shalt
live
in
this
fair
world
behind
honourd
for
husband
shalt
thou
o
such
love
must
needs
be
treason
in
my
breast
in
second
husband
let
me
be
accurst
none
wed
the
second
but
who
killd
the
first
aside
wormwood
the
instances
that
second

move
are
base
respects
of
thrift
a
second
time
i
kill
my
husband
dead
when
second
husband
kisses
me
in
bed
i
do
believe
you
think
what
now
you
speak
but
what
we
do
determine
oft
we
break
purpose
is
but
the
slave
to
memory
of
violent
birth
which
now
but
fall
most
necessary
tis
that
we
forget
to
pay
ourselves
what
to
ourselves
is
debt
what
to
ourselves
in
passion
we
propose
the
passion
ending
the
violence
of
either
grief
or
joy
their
own
enactures
with
themselves
destroy
where
joy
most
revels
grief
joys
this
world
is
not
for
aye
that
even
our
loves
should
with
our
fortunes
change
for
tis
a
question
left
us
yet
to
prove
whether
love
lead
fortune
the
great
man
down
the
poor
advanced
makes
friends
of
enemies
and
hitherto
doth
love
on
fortune
tend
for
who
not
needs
shall
never
lack
a
friend
and
who
in
want
a
hollow
friend
doth
try
directly
seasons
him
his
enemy
but
our
wills
and
fates
do
so
contrary
run
that
our
devices
still
are
overthrown
our
thoughts
are
ours
so
think
thou
wilt
no
second
husband
wed
but
die
thy
thoughts
when
thy
first
lord
is
dead
nor
earth
to
me
give

and
when

desirous
to
be

ill
blessing
beg
of
you
for
this

lord
pointing
to
polonius
i
do
repent
but
heaven
hath
pleased
it
so
to
punish
me
with
this
and
this
with
me
that
i
must
be
their
scourge
and
minister
i
will
bestow
him
the
death
i
gave
him
so
i
must
be
cruel
thus
bad

and
worse
remains
behind

more
what

let
the

king
tempt
you

to

pinch

with
his

your

me
in
your
heart
for
friend
sith
you
have
heard
that
he
which
hath
your
noble
father
slain
pursued
my
life
it
well
appears
but
tell
me
why
you
proceeded
not
against
these
feats
so
crimeful
and
so
capital
in
nature
as
by
your
safety
you
mainly
were
stirrd
up
o
which
may
to
you
but
yet
to
me
they
are
strong
the
queen
his
mother
lives
almost
by
his
looks
my
virtue
or
my
plague
shes
so
conjunctive
to
my
life
and
soul
that
i
could
not
but
by
her
the
other
motive
why
to
a
public
count
i
might
not
go
is
the
great
love
the
general
gender
bear
him
who
would
convert
his
gyves
to
graces
too
slightly
timberd
for
so
loud
a
wind
would
have
reverted
to
my
bow
again
and
not
where
i
had
aimd
them
and
so
have
i
a
noble
father
lost
a
sister
driven
into
desperate
terms
whose
worth
stood
challenger
on
mount
of
all
the
age
for
her
perfections
but
my
revenge
will
come
break
not
your
sleeps
for
that
you
must
not
think
that
we
are
made
of
stuff
so
flat
and
dull
that
we
can
let
our
beard
be
shook
with
danger
and
think
it
pastime
you
shortly
shall
hear
more
i
loved
your
father
and
that
enter

news

thereunto
and
more
strange
return
hamlet
what
should
this
mean
are
all
the
rest
come
back
or
is
it
some
abuse
know
you
the
hand
tis
hamlets
character
naked
and
in
a
postscript
here
can
you
advise
me
im
lost
in
it
it
warms
the
very
sickness
in
my
heart
that
i
shall
live
and
tell
him
to
his
teeth
thus
didest
thou
if
it
be
so
as
how
should
it
be
so
how
otherwise
will
you
be
ruled
by
me
ay
so
you
will
not
oerrule
me
to
a
peace
to
thine
own
peace
if
he
be
now
returnd
as
checking
at
his
voyage
no
more
to
undertake
it
to
an
exploit
under
the
which
he
shall
not
choose
but
fall
and
for
his
death
no
wind
of
blame
shall
breathe
but
even
his
mother
shall
uncharge
the
practise
and
call
it
accident
my
lord
the
rather
that
i
might
be
the
organ
it
falls
right
you
have
been
talkd
of
since
your
travel
much
and
that
in
hamlets
hearing
wherein
did
not
together
pluck
such
envy
from
him
as
did
that
one
of
the
unworthiest
siege
what
part
is
that
a
very
riband
in
the
cap
of
youth
yet
needful
too
the
light
and
careless
livery
that
it
wears
than
settled
age
his
sables
and
his
weeds
importing
health
and
graveness
two
months
since
here
was
a
gentleman
of
normandy
ive
seen
myself
and
they
can
well
on
horseback
but
this
gallant
had
witchcraft
int
and
to
such
wondrous
doing
brought
his
horse
as
he
had
been
incorpsed
and
deminatured
with
the
brave
beast
so
far
he
toppd
my
thought
that
i
come
short
of
what
he
did
a
norman
wast
a
norman
upon
my
life
the
very
same
i
know
him
well
he
is
the
brooch
indeed
and
gem
of
all
the
nation
he
made
confession
of
you
and
gave
you
such
a
masterly
report
for
art
and
exercise
in
your
defence
and
for
your
rapier
most
especially
that
he
cried
out
if
one
could
match
you
the
scrimers
of
their
nation
he
swore
if
you
opposed
them
sir
did
hamlet
so
envenom
with
his
envy
that
he
could
nothing
do
but
wish
and
beg
your
sudden
coming
oer
now
what
out
of
this
laertes
or
are
you
like
the
painting
of
a
sorrow
a
face
without
a
heart
why
ask
you
this
not
that
i
think
you
did
not
love
your
father
but
that
i
know
love
is
begun
by
time
and
that
i
see
time
qualifies
the
spark
and
fire
of
it
there
lives
within
the
very
flame
of
love
a
kind
of
wick
or
snuff
that
will
abate
it
and
nothing
is
at
a
like
goodness
still
for
goodness
dies
in
his
own
too
much
that
we
would
do
we
should
do
when
we
would
and
hath
abatements
and
delays
as
many
as
there
are
tongues
and
then
this
should
is
like
a
spendthrift
sigh
that
hurts
by
easing
but
hamlet
comes
back
what
would
you
undertake
to
show
yourself
your
fathers
son
in
deed
more
than
in
words
to
cut
his
throat
i
the
church
no
place
revenge
should
have
no
bounds
but
will
you
do
this
hamlet
returnd
shall
know
you
are
come
home
well
put
on
those
shall
praise
your
excellence
and
set
a
double
varnish
on
the
fame
the
frenchman
gave
you
and
wager
on
your
heads
he
most
generous
and
free
from
all
contriving
will
not
peruse
the
foils
or
with
a
little
shuffling
a
sword
unbated
requite
him
for
your
father
i
will
dot
and
i
bought
an
unction
of
a
mountebank
so
mortal
that
where
it
draws
blood
no
cataplasm
so
rare
collected
from
all
simples
that
have
virtue
under
the
moon
that
is
but
scratchd
withal
ill
touch
my
point
with
this
contagion
it
may
be
death
lets
further
think
of
this
weigh
what
convenience
both
of
time
and
means
may
fit
us
to
our
shape
if
this
should
fail
and
that
our
drift
look
through
our
bad
performance
twere
better
not
assayd
therefore
this
project
should
have
a
back
or
second
if
this
should
blast
in
proof
soft
let
me
see
well
make
a
solemn
wager
on
your
cunnings
i
hat
when
in
your
motion
you
are
hot
and
dry
as
make
your
bouts
more
violent
to
that
end
and
that
he
calls
for
drink
a
chalice
for
the
nonce
if
he
by
chance
escape
your
venomd
stuck
our
purpose
may
hold
there
enter
queen
gertrude
how
now
one
woe
doth
tread
upon
anothers
heel
so
fast
they
follow
drownd
o
there
is
a
willow
grows
aslant
a
brook
that
shows
his
hoar
leaves
in
the
glassy
stream
there
with
fantastic
garlands
did
she
come
of
crowflowers
that
liberal
shepherds
give
a
grosser
name
but
our
cold
maids
do
dead
mens
fingers
call
them
there
clambering
to
hang
when
down
her
weedy
trophies
and
herself
fell
in
the
weeping
brook
her
clothes
spread
wide
and
which
time
she
chanted
snatches
of
old
tunes
as
one
incapable
of
her
own
distress
or
like
a
creature
native
and
indued
unto
that
element
but
long
it
could
not
be
till
that
her
garments
pulld
the
poor
wretch
from
her
melodious
lay
to
muddy
death
alas
drownd
too
much
of
water
hast
thou
and
therefore
i
forbid
my
tears
but
yet
it
is
our
trick
let
shame
say
what
it
will
when
these
are
gone
the
woman
will
be
out
adieu
i
have
a
speech
of
fire
but
that
this
folly
douts
it
exit
lets
follow
how
much
i
had
to
do
to
calm
his
rage
now
fear
i
this
will
give
it
start
again
therefore
lets
follow
exeunt
act
v
scene
i
a
churchyard
enter
two
clowns
is
she
to
be
buried
in
christian
burial
that
wilfully
seeks
her
own
salvation
i
tell
thee
she
is
and
therefore
make
her
grave
straight
the
crowner
hath
sat
on
her
christian
burial
how
can
that
be
own
defence
why
it
must
be
se
offendendo
here
lies
the
point
if
i
drown
myself
wittingly
it
argues
an
act
and
an
act
hath
three
branches
it
is
herself
wittingly
nay
give
me
leave
here
lies
the
water
stands
the
man
and
drown
himself
goes
and
drown
him
that
is
not
guilty
of
his
own
death
shortens
not
his
own
life
but
is
this
law
ay
will
you
ha
the
truth
ont
if
this
had
not
been
a
gentlewoman

great
folk
should
have
countenance
in
this

methought
i
lay
worse

rashly
and
praised

rashness
for
it
our
indiscretion
sometimes

well
when
our
deep

and
that

teach
us
theres
a
divinity
that
shapes
our

how
we
will
that
is
most
certain
up

their
grand
commission
o

larded
with
many
several
sorts
of
reasons
importing
denmarks
health
and
englands
too
with
that
no
my
head
should
be
struck
off
ist
possible
heres
the
commission
read
it
at
more
leisure
but
wilt
thou
hear
me
how
i
did
proceed
i
beseech
you
being
thus
benetted
round
with
villanies
ere
i
could
make
a
prologue
to
my
brains
they
had
begun
the
playi
sat
me
down
devised
a
new
commission
i
once
did
hold
it
a
baseness
to
write
fair
and
labourd
much
how
to
forget
that
learning
it
did
me
yeomans
service
wilt
thou
know
the
effect
of
what
i
wrote
ay
an
earnest
conjuration
from
the
king
as
england
was
his
faithful
tributary
as
love
between
them
like
the
palm
might
flourish
as
peace
should
stiff
her
wheaten
garland
wear
and
stand
a
comma
tween
their
amities
and
many
suchlike
ases
of
great
charge
that
without
debatement
further
he
should
the
bearers
put
to
sudden
death
not
shrivingtime
allowd
how
was
this
seald
why
i
had
my

guildenstern

rosencrantz
go
tot
why
they
are
not
near
my
conscience
does
by
their

insinuation
grow
tis
dangerous
when
the
baser
nature
comes
between
the
pass
and
fell
incensed
points
of
mighty
opposites
why
does
it
not
he
that
hath
killd
my
king

and
my

guildenstern
are
dead
where
should
we
have
our
thanks
not
from
his
mouth
had
it
the
ability
of
life
to
thank
you
he
never
gave
commandment
for
their
death
but
since
you
from
the
polack
wars
are
here
arrived
give
order
that
these
bodies
high
on
a
stage
be
placed
to
the
view
and
let
me
speak
to
the
yet
unknowing
world
how
these
things
came
about
so
shall
you
hear
of
carnal
of
accidental
judgments
of
deaths
put
on
by
cunning
and
forced
cause
and
falln
on
the
inventors
reads
all
this
can
i
truly
deliver
let
us
haste
to
hear
it
and
call
the
noblest
to
the
audience
for
me
i
have
some
rights
of
memory
in
this
kingdom
which
now
to
claim
my
vantage
doth
invite
me
of
that
i
shall
have
also
cause
to
speak
and
from
his
mouth
whose
voice
will
draw
on
more
but
let
this
same
be
presently
performd
even
while
mens
minds
are
wild
on
plots
and
errors
let
four
captains
bear
hamlet
for
he
was
likely
to
have
proved
most
royally
and
the
soldiers
music
and
the
rites
of
war
speak
loudly
for
him
take
up
the
bodies
