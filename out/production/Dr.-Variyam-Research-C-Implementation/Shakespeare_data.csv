"32434","Hamlet","138",,"CYMBELINE","SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle."
"32435","Hamlet","138",,"CYMBELINE","FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO"
"32436","Hamlet","1","1.1.1","BERNARDO","Who's there?"
"32437","Hamlet","2","1.1.2","FRANCISCO","Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself."
"32438","Hamlet","3","1.1.3","BERNARDO","Long live the king!"
"32439","Hamlet","4","1.1.4","FRANCISCO","Bernardo?"
"32440","Hamlet","5","1.1.5","BERNARDO","He."
"32441","Hamlet","6","1.1.6","FRANCISCO","You come most carefully upon your hour."
"32442","Hamlet","7","1.1.7","BERNARDO","'Tis now struck twelve, get thee to bed, Francisco."
"32443","Hamlet","8","1.1.8","FRANCISCO","For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,"
"32444","Hamlet","8","1.1.9","FRANCISCO","And I am sick at heart."
"32445","Hamlet","9","1.1.10","BERNARDO","Have you had quiet guard?"
"32446","Hamlet","10","1.1.11","FRANCISCO","Not a mouse stirring."
"32447","Hamlet","11","1.1.12","BERNARDO","Well, good night."
"32448","Hamlet","11","1.1.13","BERNARDO","If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,"
"32449","Hamlet","11","1.1.14","BERNARDO","The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste."
"32450","Hamlet","12","1.1.15","FRANCISCO","I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?"
"32451","Hamlet","12",,"FRANCISCO","Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS"
"32452","Hamlet","13","1.1.16","HORATIO","Friends to this ground."
"32453","Hamlet","14","1.1.17","MARCELLUS","And liegemen to the Dane."
"32454","Hamlet","15","1.1.18","FRANCISCO","Give you good night."
"32455","Hamlet","16","1.1.19","MARCELLUS","O, farewell, honest soldier:"
"32456","Hamlet","16","1.1.20","MARCELLUS","Who hath relieved you?"
"32457","Hamlet","17","1.1.21","FRANCISCO","Bernardo has my place."
"32458","Hamlet","17","1.1.22","FRANCISCO","Give you good night."
"32459","Hamlet","17",,"FRANCISCO","Exit"
"32460","Hamlet","18","1.1.23","MARCELLUS","Holla! Bernardo!"
"32461","Hamlet","19","1.1.24","BERNARDO","Say,"
"32462","Hamlet","19","1.1.25","BERNARDO","What, is Horatio there?"
"32463","Hamlet","20","1.1.26","HORATIO","A piece of him."
"32464","Hamlet","21","1.1.27","BERNARDO","Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus."
"32465","Hamlet","22","1.1.28","MARCELLUS","What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?"
"32466","Hamlet","23","1.1.29","BERNARDO","I have seen nothing."
"32467","Hamlet","24","1.1.30","MARCELLUS","Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,"
"32468","Hamlet","24","1.1.31","MARCELLUS","And will not let belief take hold of him"
"32469","Hamlet","24","1.1.32","MARCELLUS","Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:"
"32470","Hamlet","24","1.1.33","MARCELLUS","Therefore I have entreated him along"
"32471","Hamlet","24","1.1.34","MARCELLUS","With us to watch the minutes of this night,"
"32472","Hamlet","24","1.1.35","MARCELLUS","That if again this apparition come,"
"32473","Hamlet","24","1.1.36","MARCELLUS","He may approve our eyes and speak to it."
"32474","Hamlet","25","1.1.37","HORATIO","Tush, tush, 'twill not appear."
"32475","Hamlet","26","1.1.38","BERNARDO","Sit down awhile,"
"32476","Hamlet","26","1.1.39","BERNARDO","And let us once again assail your ears,"
"32477","Hamlet","26","1.1.40","BERNARDO","That are so fortified against our story"
"32478","Hamlet","26","1.1.41","BERNARDO","What we have two nights seen."
"32479","Hamlet","27","1.1.42","HORATIO","Well, sit we down,"
"32480","Hamlet","27","1.1.43","HORATIO","And let us hear Bernardo speak of this."
"32481","Hamlet","28","1.1.44","BERNARDO","Last night of all,"
"32482","Hamlet","28","1.1.45","BERNARDO","When yond same star that's westward from the pole"
"32483","Hamlet","28","1.1.46","BERNARDO","Had made his course to illume that part of heaven"
"32484","Hamlet","28","1.1.47","BERNARDO","Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,"
"32485","Hamlet","28","1.1.48","BERNARDO","The bell then beating one,--"
"32486","Hamlet","28",,"BERNARDO","Enter Ghost"
"32487","Hamlet","29","1.1.49","MARCELLUS","Peace, break thee off, look, where it comes again!"
"32488","Hamlet","30","1.1.50","BERNARDO","In the same figure, like the king that's dead."
"32489","Hamlet","31","1.1.51","MARCELLUS","Thou art a scholar, speak to it, Horatio."
"32490","Hamlet","32","1.1.52","BERNARDO","Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio."
"32491","Hamlet","33","1.1.53","HORATIO","Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder."
"32492","Hamlet","34","1.1.54","BERNARDO","It would be spoke to."
"32493","Hamlet","35","1.1.55","MARCELLUS","Question it, Horatio."
"32494","Hamlet","36","1.1.56","HORATIO","What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,"
"32495","Hamlet","36","1.1.57","HORATIO","Together with that fair and warlike form"
"32496","Hamlet","36","1.1.58","HORATIO","In which the majesty of buried Denmark"
"32497","Hamlet","36","1.1.59","HORATIO","Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!"
"32498","Hamlet","37","1.1.60","MARCELLUS","It is offended."
"32499","Hamlet","38","1.1.61","BERNARDO","See, it stalks away!"
"32500","Hamlet","39","1.1.62","HORATIO","Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!"
"32501","Hamlet","39",,"HORATIO","Exit Ghost"
"32502","Hamlet","40","1.1.63","MARCELLUS","'Tis gone, and will not answer."
"32503","Hamlet","41","1.1.64","BERNARDO","How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:"
"32504","Hamlet","41","1.1.65","BERNARDO","Is not this something more than fantasy?"
"32505","Hamlet","41","1.1.66","BERNARDO","What think you on't?"
"32506","Hamlet","42","1.1.67","HORATIO","Before my God, I might not this believe"
"32507","Hamlet","42","1.1.68","HORATIO","Without the sensible and true avouch"
"32508","Hamlet","42","1.1.69","HORATIO","Of mine own eyes."
"32509","Hamlet","43","1.1.70","MARCELLUS","Is it not like the king?"
"32510","Hamlet","44","1.1.71","HORATIO","As thou art to thyself:"
"32511","Hamlet","44","1.1.72","HORATIO","Such was the very armour he had on"
"32512","Hamlet","44","1.1.73","HORATIO","When he the ambitious Norway combated,"
"32513","Hamlet","44","1.1.74","HORATIO","So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,"
"32514","Hamlet","44","1.1.75","HORATIO","He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice."
"32515","Hamlet","44","1.1.76","HORATIO","'Tis strange."
"32516","Hamlet","45","1.1.77","MARCELLUS","Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,"
"32517","Hamlet","45","1.1.78","MARCELLUS","With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch."
"32518","Hamlet","46","1.1.79","HORATIO","In what particular thought to work I know not,"
"32519","Hamlet","46","1.1.80","HORATIO","But in the gross and scope of my opinion,"
"32520","Hamlet","46","1.1.81","HORATIO","This bodes some strange eruption to our state."
"32521","Hamlet","47","1.1.82","MARCELLUS","Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,"
"32522","Hamlet","47","1.1.83","MARCELLUS","Why this same strict and most observant watch"
"32523","Hamlet","47","1.1.84","MARCELLUS","So nightly toils the subject of the land,"
"32524","Hamlet","47","1.1.85","MARCELLUS","And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,"
"32525","Hamlet","47","1.1.86","MARCELLUS","And foreign mart for implements of war,"
"32526","Hamlet","47","1.1.87","MARCELLUS","Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task"
"32527","Hamlet","47","1.1.88","MARCELLUS","Does not divide the Sunday from the week,"
"32528","Hamlet","47","1.1.89","MARCELLUS","What might be toward, that this sweaty haste"
"32529","Hamlet","47","1.1.90","MARCELLUS","Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:"
"32530","Hamlet","47","1.1.91","MARCELLUS","Who is't that can inform me?"
"32531","Hamlet","48","1.1.92","HORATIO","That can I,"
"32532","Hamlet","48","1.1.93","HORATIO","At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,"
"32533","Hamlet","48","1.1.94","HORATIO","Whose image even but now appear'd to us,"
"32534","Hamlet","48","1.1.95","HORATIO","Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,"
"32535","Hamlet","48","1.1.96","HORATIO","Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,"
"32536","Hamlet","48","1.1.97","HORATIO","Dared to the combat, in which our valiant Hamlet--"
"32537","Hamlet","48","1.1.98","HORATIO","For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--"
"32538","Hamlet","48","1.1.99","HORATIO","Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a seal'd compact,"
"32539","Hamlet","48","1.1.100","HORATIO","Well ratified by law and heraldry,"
"32540","Hamlet","48","1.1.101","HORATIO","Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands"
"32541","Hamlet","48","1.1.102","HORATIO","Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:"
"32542","Hamlet","48","1.1.103","HORATIO","Against the which, a moiety competent"
"32543","Hamlet","48","1.1.104","HORATIO","Was gaged by our king, which had return'd"
"32544","Hamlet","48","1.1.105","HORATIO","To the inheritance of Fortinbras,"
"32545","Hamlet","48","1.1.106","HORATIO","Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same covenant,"
"32546","Hamlet","48","1.1.107","HORATIO","And carriage of the article design'd,"
"32547","Hamlet","48","1.1.108","HORATIO","His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,"
"32548","Hamlet","48","1.1.109","HORATIO","Of unimproved mettle hot and full,"
"32549","Hamlet","48","1.1.110","HORATIO","Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there"
"32550","Hamlet","48","1.1.111","HORATIO","Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,"
"32551","Hamlet","48","1.1.112","HORATIO","For food and diet, to some enterprise"
"32552","Hamlet","48","1.1.113","HORATIO","That hath a stomach in't, which is no other--"
"32553","Hamlet","48","1.1.114","HORATIO","As it doth well appear unto our state--"
"32554","Hamlet","48","1.1.115","HORATIO","But to recover of us, by strong hand"
"32555","Hamlet","48","1.1.116","HORATIO","And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands"
"32556","Hamlet","48","1.1.117","HORATIO","So by his father lost: and this, I take it,"
"32557","Hamlet","48","1.1.118","HORATIO","Is the main motive of our preparations,"
"32558","Hamlet","48","1.1.119","HORATIO","The source of this our watch and the chief head"
"32559","Hamlet","48","1.1.120","HORATIO","Of this post-haste and romage in the land."
"32560","Hamlet","49","1.1.121","BERNARDO","I think it be no other but e'en so:"
"32561","Hamlet","49","1.1.122","BERNARDO","Well may it sort that this portentous figure"
"32562","Hamlet","49","1.1.123","BERNARDO","Comes armed through our watch, so like the king"
"32563","Hamlet","49","1.1.124","BERNARDO","That was and is the question of these wars."
"32564","Hamlet","50","1.1.125","HORATIO","A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye."
"32565","Hamlet","50","1.1.126","HORATIO","In the most high and palmy state of Rome,"
"32566","Hamlet","50","1.1.127","HORATIO","A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,"
"32567","Hamlet","50","1.1.128","HORATIO","The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead"
"32568","Hamlet","50","1.1.129","HORATIO","Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:"
"32569","Hamlet","50","1.1.130","HORATIO","As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,"
"32570","Hamlet","50","1.1.131","HORATIO","Disasters in the sun, and the moist star"
"32571","Hamlet","50","1.1.132","HORATIO","Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands"
"32572","Hamlet","50","1.1.133","HORATIO","Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:"
"32573","Hamlet","50","1.1.134","HORATIO","And even the like precurse of fierce events,"
"32574","Hamlet","50","1.1.135","HORATIO","As harbingers preceding still the fates"
"32575","Hamlet","50","1.1.136","HORATIO","And prologue to the omen coming on,"
"32576","Hamlet","50","1.1.137","HORATIO","Have heaven and earth together demonstrated"
"32577","Hamlet","50","1.1.138","HORATIO","Unto our climatures and countrymen.--"
"32578","Hamlet","50","1.1.139","HORATIO","But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!"
"32579","Hamlet","50",,"HORATIO","Re-enter Ghost"
"32580","Hamlet","50","1.1.140","HORATIO","I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!"
"32581","Hamlet","50","1.1.141","HORATIO","If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,"
"32582","Hamlet","50","1.1.142","HORATIO","Speak to me:"
"32583","Hamlet","50","1.1.143","HORATIO","If there be any good thing to be done,"
"32584","Hamlet","50","1.1.144","HORATIO","That may to thee do ease and grace to me,"
"32585","Hamlet","50","1.1.145","HORATIO","Speak to me:"
"32586","Hamlet","50",,"HORATIO","Cock crows"
"32587","Hamlet","50","1.1.146","HORATIO","If thou art privy to thy country's fate,"
"32588","Hamlet","50","1.1.147","HORATIO","Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!"
"32589","Hamlet","50","1.1.148","HORATIO","Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life"
"32590","Hamlet","50","1.1.149","HORATIO","Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,"
"32591","Hamlet","50","1.1.150","HORATIO","For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,"
"32592","Hamlet","50","1.1.151","HORATIO","Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus."
"32593","Hamlet","51","1.1.152","MARCELLUS","Shall I strike at it with my partisan?"
"32594","Hamlet","52","1.1.153","HORATIO","Do, if it will not stand."
"32595","Hamlet","53","1.1.154","BERNARDO","'Tis here!"
"32596","Hamlet","54","1.1.155","HORATIO","'Tis here!"
"32597","Hamlet","55","1.1.156","MARCELLUS","'Tis gone!"
"32598","Hamlet","55",,"MARCELLUS","Exit Ghost"
"32599","Hamlet","55","1.1.157","MARCELLUS","We do it wrong, being so majestical,"
"32600","Hamlet","55","1.1.158","MARCELLUS","To offer it the show of violence,"
"32601","Hamlet","55","1.1.159","MARCELLUS","For it is, as the air, invulnerable,"
"32602","Hamlet","55","1.1.160","MARCELLUS","And our vain blows malicious mockery."
"32603","Hamlet","56","1.1.161","BERNARDO","It was about to speak, when the cock crew."
"32604","Hamlet","57","1.1.162","HORATIO","And then it started like a guilty thing"
"32605","Hamlet","57","1.1.163","HORATIO","Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,"
"32606","Hamlet","57","1.1.164","HORATIO","The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,"
"32607","Hamlet","57","1.1.165","HORATIO","Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat"
"32608","Hamlet","57","1.1.166","HORATIO","Awake the god of day, and, at his warning,"
"32609","Hamlet","57","1.1.167","HORATIO","Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,"
"32610","Hamlet","57","1.1.168","HORATIO","The extravagant and erring spirit hies"
"32611","Hamlet","57","1.1.169","HORATIO","To his confine: and of the truth herein"
"32612","Hamlet","57","1.1.170","HORATIO","This present object made probation."
"32613","Hamlet","58","1.1.171","MARCELLUS","It faded on the crowing of the cock."
"32614","Hamlet","58","1.1.172","MARCELLUS","Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes"
"32615","Hamlet","58","1.1.173","MARCELLUS","Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,"
"32616","Hamlet","58","1.1.174","MARCELLUS","The bird of dawning singeth all night long:"
"32617","Hamlet","58","1.1.175","MARCELLUS","And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad,"
"32618","Hamlet","58","1.1.176","MARCELLUS","The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,"
"32619","Hamlet","58","1.1.177","MARCELLUS","No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,"
"32620","Hamlet","58","1.1.178","MARCELLUS","So hallow'd and so gracious is the time."
"32621","Hamlet","59","1.1.179","HORATIO","So have I heard and do in part believe it."
"32622","Hamlet","59","1.1.180","HORATIO","But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,"
"32623","Hamlet","59","1.1.181","HORATIO","Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:"
"32624","Hamlet","59","1.1.182","HORATIO","Break we our watch up, and by my advice,"
"32625","Hamlet","59","1.1.183","HORATIO","Let us impart what we have seen to-night"
"32626","Hamlet","59","1.1.184","HORATIO","Unto young Hamlet, for, upon my life,"
"32627","Hamlet","59","1.1.185","HORATIO","This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him."
"32628","Hamlet","59","1.1.186","HORATIO","Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,"
"32629","Hamlet","59","1.1.187","HORATIO","As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?"
"32630","Hamlet","60","1.1.188","MARCELLUS","Let's do't, I pray, and I this morning know"
"32631","Hamlet","60","1.1.189","MARCELLUS","Where we shall find him most conveniently."
"32632","Hamlet","60",,"MARCELLUS","Exeunt"
"32633","Hamlet","60",,"MARCELLUS","SCENE II. A room of state in the castle."
"32634","Hamlet","60",,"MARCELLUS","Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,  POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants"

"32645","Hamlet","1","1.2.11","KING CLAUDIUS","With an auspicious and a dropping eye,"
"32646","Hamlet","1","1.2.12","KING CLAUDIUS","With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,"

"32648","Hamlet","1","1.2.14","KING CLAUDIUS","Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd"
"32649","Hamlet","1","1.2.15","KING CLAUDIUS","Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone"
"32650","Hamlet","1","1.2.16","KING CLAUDIUS","With this affair along. For all, our thanks."
"32651","Hamlet","1","1.2.17","KING CLAUDIUS","Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,"
"32652","Hamlet","1","1.2.18","KING CLAUDIUS","Holding a weak supposal of our worth,"

"32654","Hamlet","1","1.2.20","KING CLAUDIUS","Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,"
"32655","Hamlet","1","1.2.21","KING CLAUDIUS","Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,"

"32675","Hamlet","4","1.2.41","KING CLAUDIUS","We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell."
"32676","Hamlet","4",,"KING CLAUDIUS","Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS"
"32677","Hamlet","4","1.2.42","KING CLAUDIUS","And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?"
"32678","Hamlet","4","1.2.43","KING CLAUDIUS","You told us of some suit, what is't, Laertes?"
"32679","Hamlet","4","1.2.44","KING CLAUDIUS","You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,"
"32680","Hamlet","4","1.2.45","KING CLAUDIUS","And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,"
"32681","Hamlet","4","1.2.46","KING CLAUDIUS","That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?"
"32682","Hamlet","4","1.2.47","KING CLAUDIUS","The head is not more native to the heart,"
"32683","Hamlet","4","1.2.48","KING CLAUDIUS","The hand more instrumental to the mouth,"
"32684","Hamlet","4","1.2.49","KING CLAUDIUS","Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father."
"32685","Hamlet","4","1.2.50","KING CLAUDIUS","What wouldst thou have, Laertes?"
"32686","Hamlet","5","1.2.51","LAERTES","My dread lord,"
"32687","Hamlet","5","1.2.52","LAERTES","Your leave and favour to return to France,"
"32688","Hamlet","5","1.2.53","LAERTES","From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,"
"32689","Hamlet","5","1.2.54","LAERTES","To show my duty in your coronation,"
"32690","Hamlet","5","1.2.55","LAERTES","Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,"
"32691","Hamlet","5","1.2.56","LAERTES","My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France"
"32692","Hamlet","5","1.2.57","LAERTES","And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon."
"32693","Hamlet","6","1.2.58","KING CLAUDIUS","Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?"
"32694","Hamlet","7","1.2.59","LORD POLONIUS","He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave"
"32695","Hamlet","7","1.2.60","LORD POLONIUS","By laboursome petition, and at last"
"32696","Hamlet","7","1.2.61","LORD POLONIUS","Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:"
"32697","Hamlet","7","1.2.62","LORD POLONIUS","I do beseech you, give him leave to go."
"32698","Hamlet","8","1.2.63","KING CLAUDIUS","Take thy fair hour, Laertes, time be thine,"
"32699","Hamlet","8","1.2.64","KING CLAUDIUS","And thy best graces spend it at thy will!"
"32700","Hamlet","8","1.2.65","KING CLAUDIUS","But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--"
"32701","Hamlet","9","1.2.66","HAMLET","[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind."
"32702","Hamlet","10","1.2.67","KING CLAUDIUS","How is it that the clouds still hang on you?"
"32703","Hamlet","11","1.2.68","HAMLET","Not so, my lord, I am too much i' the sun."
"32704","Hamlet","12","1.2.69","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,"
"32705","Hamlet","12","1.2.70","QUEEN GERTRUDE","And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark."
"32706","Hamlet","12","1.2.71","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Do not for ever with thy vailed lids"
"32707","Hamlet","12","1.2.72","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Seek for thy noble father in the dust:"
"32708","Hamlet","12","1.2.73","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Thou know'st 'tis common, all that lives must die,"
"32709","Hamlet","12","1.2.74","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Passing through nature to eternity."
"32710","Hamlet","13","1.2.75","HAMLET","Ay, madam, it is common."
"32711","Hamlet","14","1.2.76","QUEEN GERTRUDE","If it be,"
"32712","Hamlet","14","1.2.77","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Why seems it so particular with thee?"
"32713","Hamlet","15","1.2.78","HAMLET","Seems, madam! nay it is, I know not 'seems.'"
"32714","Hamlet","15","1.2.79","HAMLET","'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,"
"32715","Hamlet","15","1.2.80","HAMLET","Nor customary suits of solemn black,"
"32716","Hamlet","15","1.2.81","HAMLET","Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,"
"32717","Hamlet","15","1.2.82","HAMLET","No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,"
"32718","Hamlet","15","1.2.83","HAMLET","Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,"
"32719","Hamlet","15","1.2.84","HAMLET","Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,"
"32720","Hamlet","15","1.2.85","HAMLET","That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,"
"32721","Hamlet","15","1.2.86","HAMLET","For they are actions that a man might play:"
"32722","Hamlet","15","1.2.87","HAMLET","But I have that within which passeth show,"
"32723","Hamlet","15","1.2.88","HAMLET","These but the trappings and the suits of woe."
"32724","Hamlet","16","1.2.89","KING CLAUDIUS","'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,"
"32725","Hamlet","16","1.2.90","KING CLAUDIUS","To give these mourning duties to your father:"
"32726","Hamlet","16","1.2.91","KING CLAUDIUS","But, you must know, your father lost a father,"
"32727","Hamlet","16","1.2.92","KING CLAUDIUS","That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound"
"32728","Hamlet","16","1.2.93","KING CLAUDIUS","In filial obligation for some term"
"32729","Hamlet","16","1.2.94","KING CLAUDIUS","To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever"
"32730","Hamlet","16","1.2.95","KING CLAUDIUS","In obstinate condolement is a course"
"32731","Hamlet","16","1.2.96","KING CLAUDIUS","Of impious stubbornness, 'tis unmanly grief,"
"32732","Hamlet","16","1.2.97","KING CLAUDIUS","It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,"
"32733","Hamlet","16","1.2.98","KING CLAUDIUS","A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,"
"32734","Hamlet","16","1.2.99","KING CLAUDIUS","An understanding simple and unschool'd:"
"32735","Hamlet","16","1.2.100","KING CLAUDIUS","For what we know must be and is as common"
"32736","Hamlet","16","1.2.101","KING CLAUDIUS","As any the most vulgar thing to sense,"
"32737","Hamlet","16","1.2.102","KING CLAUDIUS","Why should we in our peevish opposition"
"32738","Hamlet","16","1.2.103","KING CLAUDIUS","Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,"
"32739","Hamlet","16","1.2.104","KING CLAUDIUS","A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,"
"32740","Hamlet","16","1.2.105","KING CLAUDIUS","To reason most absurd: whose common theme"
"32741","Hamlet","16","1.2.106","KING CLAUDIUS","Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,"
"32742","Hamlet","16","1.2.107","KING CLAUDIUS","From the first corse till he that died to-day,"
"32743","Hamlet","16","1.2.108","KING CLAUDIUS","'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth"
"32744","Hamlet","16","1.2.109","KING CLAUDIUS","This unprevailing woe, and think of us"
"32745","Hamlet","16","1.2.110","KING CLAUDIUS","As of a father: for let the world take note,"
"32746","Hamlet","16","1.2.111","KING CLAUDIUS","You are the most immediate to our throne,"
"32747","Hamlet","16","1.2.112","KING CLAUDIUS","And with no less nobility of love"
"32748","Hamlet","16","1.2.113","KING CLAUDIUS","Than that which dearest father bears his son,"
"32749","Hamlet","16","1.2.114","KING CLAUDIUS","Do I impart toward you. For your intent"
"32750","Hamlet","16","1.2.115","KING CLAUDIUS","In going back to school in Wittenberg,"
"32751","Hamlet","16","1.2.116","KING CLAUDIUS","It is most retrograde to our desire:"
"32752","Hamlet","16","1.2.117","KING CLAUDIUS","And we beseech you, bend you to remain"
"32753","Hamlet","16","1.2.118","KING CLAUDIUS","Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,"
"32754","Hamlet","16","1.2.119","KING CLAUDIUS","Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son."
"32755","Hamlet","17","1.2.120","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:"

"32757","Hamlet","18","1.2.122","HAMLET","I shall in all my best obey you, madam."
"32758","Hamlet","19","1.2.123","KING CLAUDIUS","Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:"
"32759","Hamlet","19","1.2.124","KING CLAUDIUS","Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come,"
"32760","Hamlet","19","1.2.125","KING CLAUDIUS","This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet"
"32761","Hamlet","19","1.2.126","KING CLAUDIUS","Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,"
"32762","Hamlet","19","1.2.127","KING CLAUDIUS","No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,"
"32763","Hamlet","19","1.2.128","KING CLAUDIUS","But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,"

"32767","Hamlet","20","1.2.131","HAMLET","O, that this too too solid flesh would melt"
"32768","Hamlet","20","1.2.132","HAMLET","Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!"
"32769","Hamlet","20","1.2.133","HAMLET","Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd"

"32771","Hamlet","20","1.2.135","HAMLET","How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,"
"32772","Hamlet","20","1.2.136","HAMLET","Seem to me all the uses of this world!"
"32773","Hamlet","20","1.2.137","HAMLET","Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,"
"32774","Hamlet","20","1.2.138","HAMLET","That grows to seed, things rank and gross in nature"
"32775","Hamlet","20","1.2.139","HAMLET","Possess it merely. That it should come to this!"
"32776","Hamlet","20","1.2.140","HAMLET","But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:"
"32777","Hamlet","20","1.2.141","HAMLET","So excellent a king, that was, to this,"

"32781","Hamlet","20","1.2.145","HAMLET","Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,"
"32782","Hamlet","20","1.2.146","HAMLET","As if increase of appetite had grown"
"32783","Hamlet","20","1.2.147","HAMLET","By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--"
"32784","Hamlet","20","1.2.148","HAMLET","Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--"
"32785","Hamlet","20","1.2.149","HAMLET","A little month, or ere those shoes were old"
"32786","Hamlet","20","1.2.150","HAMLET","With which she follow'd my poor father's body,"

"32788","Hamlet","20","1.2.152","HAMLET","O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,"
"32789","Hamlet","20","1.2.153","HAMLET","Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,"
"32790","Hamlet","20","1.2.154","HAMLET","My father's brother, but no more like my father"
"32791","Hamlet","20","1.2.155","HAMLET","Than I to Hercules: within a month:"
"32792","Hamlet","20","1.2.156","HAMLET","Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears"
"32793","Hamlet","20","1.2.157","HAMLET","Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,"
"32794","Hamlet","20","1.2.158","HAMLET","She married. O, most wicked speed, to post"

"32796","Hamlet","20","1.2.160","HAMLET","It is not nor it cannot come to good:"
"32797","Hamlet","20","1.2.161","HAMLET","But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue."
"32798","Hamlet","20",,"HAMLET","Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO"
"32799","Hamlet","21","1.2.162","HORATIO","Hail to your lordship!"
"32800","Hamlet","22","1.2.163","HAMLET","I am glad to see you well:"
"32801","Hamlet","22","1.2.164","HAMLET","Horatio,--or I do forget myself."
"32802","Hamlet","23","1.2.165","HORATIO","The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever."
"32803","Hamlet","24","1.2.166","HAMLET","Sir, my good friend, I'll change that name with you:"
"32804","Hamlet","24","1.2.167","HAMLET","And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?"
"32805","Hamlet","25","1.2.168","MARCELLUS","My good lord--"
"32806","Hamlet","26","1.2.169","HAMLET","I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir."
"32807","Hamlet","26","1.2.170","HAMLET","But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?"
"32808","Hamlet","27","1.2.171","HORATIO","A truant disposition, good my lord."
"32809","Hamlet","28","1.2.172","HAMLET","I would not hear your enemy say so,"
"32810","Hamlet","28","1.2.173","HAMLET","Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,"
"32811","Hamlet","28","1.2.174","HAMLET","To make it truster of your own report"
"32812","Hamlet","28","1.2.175","HAMLET","Against yourself: I know you are no truant."
"32813","Hamlet","28","1.2.176","HAMLET","But what is your affair in Elsinore?"
"32814","Hamlet","28","1.2.177","HAMLET","We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart."
"32815","Hamlet","29","1.2.178","HORATIO","My lord, I came to see your father's funeral."
"32816","Hamlet","30","1.2.179","HAMLET","I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student,"
"32817","Hamlet","30","1.2.180","HAMLET","I think it was to see my mother's wedding."
"32818","Hamlet","31","1.2.181","HORATIO","Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon."
"32819","Hamlet","32","1.2.182","HAMLET","Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats"
"32820","Hamlet","32","1.2.183","HAMLET","Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables."
"32821","Hamlet","32","1.2.184","HAMLET","Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven"
"32822","Hamlet","32","1.2.185","HAMLET","Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!"
"32823","Hamlet","32","1.2.186","HAMLET","My father!--methinks I see my father."
"32824","Hamlet","33","1.2.187","HORATIO","Where, my lord?"
"32825","Hamlet","34","1.2.188","HAMLET","In my mind's eye, Horatio."
"32826","Hamlet","35","1.2.189","HORATIO","I saw him once, he was a goodly king."
"32827","Hamlet","36","1.2.190","HAMLET","He was a man, take him for all in all,"
"32828","Hamlet","36","1.2.191","HAMLET","I shall not look upon his like again."
"32829","Hamlet","37","1.2.192","HORATIO","My lord, I think I saw him yesternight."
"32830","Hamlet","38","1.2.193","HAMLET","Saw? who?"
"32831","Hamlet","39","1.2.194","HORATIO","My lord, the king your father."
"32832","Hamlet","40","1.2.195","HAMLET","The king my father!"
"32833","Hamlet","41","1.2.196","HORATIO","Season your admiration for awhile"
"32834","Hamlet","41","1.2.197","HORATIO","With an attent ear, till I may deliver,"
"32835","Hamlet","41","1.2.198","HORATIO","Upon the witness of these gentlemen,"
"32836","Hamlet","41","1.2.199","HORATIO","This marvel to you."
"32837","Hamlet","42","1.2.200","HAMLET","For God's love, let me hear."
"32838","Hamlet","43","1.2.201","HORATIO","Two nights together had these gentlemen,"
"32839","Hamlet","43","1.2.202","HORATIO","Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,"
"32840","Hamlet","43","1.2.203","HORATIO","In the dead vast and middle of the night,"
"32841","Hamlet","43","1.2.204","HORATIO","Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,"
"32842","Hamlet","43","1.2.205","HORATIO","Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,"
"32843","Hamlet","43","1.2.206","HORATIO","Appears before them, and with solemn march"
"32844","Hamlet","43","1.2.207","HORATIO","Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd"
"32845","Hamlet","43","1.2.208","HORATIO","By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,"
"32846","Hamlet","43","1.2.209","HORATIO","Within his truncheon's length, whilst they, distilled"
"32847","Hamlet","43","1.2.210","HORATIO","Almost to jelly with the act of fear,"
"32848","Hamlet","43","1.2.211","HORATIO","Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me"
"32849","Hamlet","43","1.2.212","HORATIO","In dreadful secrecy impart they did,"
"32850","Hamlet","43","1.2.213","HORATIO","And I with them the third night kept the watch,"
"32851","Hamlet","43","1.2.214","HORATIO","Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,"
"32852","Hamlet","43","1.2.215","HORATIO","Form of the thing, each word made true and good,"
"32853","Hamlet","43","1.2.216","HORATIO","The apparition comes: I knew your father,"
"32854","Hamlet","43","1.2.217","HORATIO","These hands are not more like."
"32855","Hamlet","44","1.2.218","HAMLET","But where was this?"
"32856","Hamlet","45","1.2.219","MARCELLUS","My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd."
"32857","Hamlet","46","1.2.220","HAMLET","Did you not speak to it?"
"32858","Hamlet","47","1.2.221","HORATIO","My lord, I did,"
"32859","Hamlet","47","1.2.222","HORATIO","But answer made it none: yet once methought"
"32860","Hamlet","47","1.2.223","HORATIO","It lifted up its head and did address"
"32861","Hamlet","47","1.2.224","HORATIO","Itself to motion, like as it would speak,"
"32862","Hamlet","47","1.2.225","HORATIO","But even then the morning cock crew loud,"
"32863","Hamlet","47","1.2.226","HORATIO","And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,"
"32864","Hamlet","47","1.2.227","HORATIO","And vanish'd from our sight."
"32865","Hamlet","48","1.2.228","HAMLET","'Tis very strange."
"32866","Hamlet","49","1.2.229","HORATIO","As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true,"
"32867","Hamlet","49","1.2.230","HORATIO","And we did think it writ down in our duty"
"32868","Hamlet","49","1.2.231","HORATIO","To let you know of it."
"32869","Hamlet","50","1.2.232","HAMLET","Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me."
"32870","Hamlet","50","1.2.233","HAMLET","Hold you the watch to-night?"
"32871","Hamlet","52","1.2.234","BERNARDO","We do, my lord."
"32872","Hamlet","53","1.2.235","HAMLET","Arm'd, say you?"
"32873","Hamlet","55","1.2.236","BERNARDO","Arm'd, my lord."
"32874","Hamlet","56","1.2.237","HAMLET","From top to toe?"
"32875","Hamlet","58","1.2.238","BERNARDO","My lord, from head to foot."
"32876","Hamlet","59","1.2.239","HAMLET","Then saw you not his face?"
"32877","Hamlet","60","1.2.240","HORATIO","O, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up."
"32878","Hamlet","61","1.2.241","HAMLET","What, look'd he frowningly?"
"32879","Hamlet","62","1.2.242","HORATIO","A countenance more in sorrow than in anger."
"32880","Hamlet","63","1.2.243","HAMLET","Pale or red?"
"32881","Hamlet","64","1.2.244","HORATIO","Nay, very pale."
"32882","Hamlet","65","1.2.245","HAMLET","And fix'd his eyes upon you?"
"32883","Hamlet","66","1.2.246","HORATIO","Most constantly."
"32884","Hamlet","67","1.2.247","HAMLET","I would I had been there."
"32885","Hamlet","68","1.2.248","HORATIO","It would have much amazed you."
"32886","Hamlet","69","1.2.249","HAMLET","Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?"
"32887","Hamlet","70","1.2.250","HORATIO","While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred."
"32888","Hamlet","72","1.2.251","BERNARDO","Longer, longer."
"32889","Hamlet","73","1.2.252","HORATIO","Not when I saw't."
"32890","Hamlet","74","1.2.253","HAMLET","His beard was grizzled--no?"
"32891","Hamlet","75","1.2.254","HORATIO","It was, as I have seen it in his life,"
"32892","Hamlet","75","1.2.255","HORATIO","A sable silver'd."
"32893","Hamlet","76","1.2.256","HAMLET","I will watch to-night,"
"32894","Hamlet","76","1.2.257","HAMLET","Perchance 'twill walk again."
"32895","Hamlet","77","1.2.258","HORATIO","I warrant it will."
"32896","Hamlet","78","1.2.259","HAMLET","If it assume my noble father's person,"
"32897","Hamlet","78","1.2.260","HAMLET","I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape"
"32898","Hamlet","78","1.2.261","HAMLET","And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,"
"32899","Hamlet","78","1.2.262","HAMLET","If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,"
"32900","Hamlet","78","1.2.263","HAMLET","Let it be tenable in your silence still,"
"32901","Hamlet","78","1.2.264","HAMLET","And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,"
"32902","Hamlet","78","1.2.265","HAMLET","Give it an understanding, but no tongue:"
"32903","Hamlet","78","1.2.266","HAMLET","I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:"
"32904","Hamlet","78","1.2.267","HAMLET","Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,"
"32905","Hamlet","78","1.2.268","HAMLET","I'll visit you."
"32906","Hamlet","79","1.2.269","All","Our duty to your honour."
"32907","Hamlet","80","1.2.270","HAMLET","Your loves, as mine to you: farewell."
"32908","Hamlet","80",,"HAMLET","Exeunt all but HAMLET"
"32909","Hamlet","80","1.2.271","HAMLET","My father's spirit in arms! all is not well,"
"32910","Hamlet","80","1.2.272","HAMLET","I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!"
"32911","Hamlet","80","1.2.273","HAMLET","Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,"
"32912","Hamlet","80","1.2.274","HAMLET","Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes."

"32914","Hamlet","80",,"HAMLET","SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house."
"32915","Hamlet","80",,"HAMLET","Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA"
"32916","Hamlet","1","1.3.1","LAERTES","My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:"
"32917","Hamlet","1","1.3.2","LAERTES","And, sister, as the winds give benefit"
"32918","Hamlet","1","1.3.3","LAERTES","And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,"
"32919","Hamlet","1","1.3.4","LAERTES","But let me hear from you."
"32920","Hamlet","2","1.3.5","OPHELIA","Do you doubt that?"
"32921","Hamlet","3","1.3.6","LAERTES","For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,"
"32922","Hamlet","3","1.3.7","LAERTES","Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,"
"32923","Hamlet","3","1.3.8","LAERTES","A violet in the youth of primy nature,"
"32924","Hamlet","3","1.3.9","LAERTES","Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,"
"32925","Hamlet","3","1.3.10","LAERTES","The perfume and suppliance of a minute, No more."
"32926","Hamlet","4","1.3.11","OPHELIA","No more but so?"
"32927","Hamlet","5","1.3.12","LAERTES","Think it no more,"
"32928","Hamlet","5","1.3.13","LAERTES","For nature, crescent, does not grow alone"
"32929","Hamlet","5","1.3.14","LAERTES","In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,"
"32930","Hamlet","5","1.3.15","LAERTES","The inward service of the mind and soul"
"32931","Hamlet","5","1.3.16","LAERTES","Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,"
"32932","Hamlet","5","1.3.17","LAERTES","And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch"
"32933","Hamlet","5","1.3.18","LAERTES","The virtue of his will: but you must fear,"
"32934","Hamlet","5","1.3.19","LAERTES","His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own,"
"32935","Hamlet","5","1.3.20","LAERTES","For he himself is subject to his birth:"
"32936","Hamlet","5","1.3.21","LAERTES","He may not, as unvalued persons do,"
"32937","Hamlet","5","1.3.22","LAERTES","Carve for himself, for on his choice depends"
"32938","Hamlet","5","1.3.23","LAERTES","The safety and health of this whole state,"
"32939","Hamlet","5","1.3.24","LAERTES","And therefore must his choice be circumscribed"
"32940","Hamlet","5","1.3.25","LAERTES","Unto the voice and yielding of that body"
"32941","Hamlet","5","1.3.26","LAERTES","Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,"
"32942","Hamlet","5","1.3.27","LAERTES","It fits your wisdom so far to believe it"
"32943","Hamlet","5","1.3.28","LAERTES","As he in his particular act and place"
"32944","Hamlet","5","1.3.29","LAERTES","May give his saying deed, which is no further"
"32945","Hamlet","5","1.3.30","LAERTES","Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal."
"32946","Hamlet","5","1.3.31","LAERTES","Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,"
"32947","Hamlet","5","1.3.32","LAERTES","If with too credent ear you list his songs,"
"32948","Hamlet","5","1.3.33","LAERTES","Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open"
"32949","Hamlet","5","1.3.34","LAERTES","To his unmaster'd importunity."
"32950","Hamlet","5","1.3.35","LAERTES","Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,"
"32951","Hamlet","5","1.3.36","LAERTES","And keep you in the rear of your affection,"
"32952","Hamlet","5","1.3.37","LAERTES","Out of the shot and danger of desire."
"32953","Hamlet","5","1.3.38","LAERTES","The chariest maid is prodigal enough,"
"32954","Hamlet","5","1.3.39","LAERTES","If she unmask her beauty to the moon:"
"32955","Hamlet","5","1.3.40","LAERTES","Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:"
"32956","Hamlet","5","1.3.41","LAERTES","The canker galls the infants of the spring,"
"32957","Hamlet","5","1.3.42","LAERTES","Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,"
"32958","Hamlet","5","1.3.43","LAERTES","And in the morn and liquid dew of youth"
"32959","Hamlet","5","1.3.44","LAERTES","Contagious blastments are most imminent."
"32960","Hamlet","5","1.3.45","LAERTES","Be wary then, best safety lies in fear:"
"32961","Hamlet","5","1.3.46","LAERTES","Youth to itself rebels, though none else near."
"32962","Hamlet","6","1.3.47","OPHELIA","I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,"
"32963","Hamlet","6","1.3.48","OPHELIA","As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,"
"32964","Hamlet","6","1.3.49","OPHELIA","Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,"
"32965","Hamlet","6","1.3.50","OPHELIA","Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,"
"32966","Hamlet","6","1.3.51","OPHELIA","Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,"
"32967","Hamlet","6","1.3.52","OPHELIA","Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,"
"32968","Hamlet","6","1.3.53","OPHELIA","And recks not his own rede."
"32969","Hamlet","7","1.3.54","LAERTES","O, fear me not."
"32970","Hamlet","7","1.3.55","LAERTES","I stay too long: but here my father comes."
"32971","Hamlet","7",,"LAERTES","Enter POLONIUS"
"32972","Hamlet","7","1.3.56","LAERTES","A double blessing is a double grace,"
"32973","Hamlet","7","1.3.57","LAERTES","Occasion smiles upon a second leave."
"32974","Hamlet","8","1.3.58","LORD POLONIUS","Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!"
"32975","Hamlet","8","1.3.59","LORD POLONIUS","The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,"
"32976","Hamlet","8","1.3.60","LORD POLONIUS","And you are stay'd for. There, my blessing with thee!"
"32977","Hamlet","8","1.3.61","LORD POLONIUS","And these few precepts in thy memory"
"32978","Hamlet","8","1.3.62","LORD POLONIUS","See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,"
"32979","Hamlet","8","1.3.63","LORD POLONIUS","Nor any unproportioned thought his act."
"32980","Hamlet","8","1.3.64","LORD POLONIUS","Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar."
"32981","Hamlet","8","1.3.65","LORD POLONIUS","Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,"
"32982","Hamlet","8","1.3.66","LORD POLONIUS","Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel,"
"32983","Hamlet","8","1.3.67","LORD POLONIUS","But do not dull thy palm with entertainment"
"32984","Hamlet","8","1.3.68","LORD POLONIUS","Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware"
"32985","Hamlet","8","1.3.69","LORD POLONIUS","Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,"
"32986","Hamlet","8","1.3.70","LORD POLONIUS","Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee."
"32987","Hamlet","8","1.3.71","LORD POLONIUS","Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice,"
"32988","Hamlet","8","1.3.72","LORD POLONIUS","Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment."
"32989","Hamlet","8","1.3.73","LORD POLONIUS","Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,"
"32990","Hamlet","8","1.3.74","LORD POLONIUS","But not express'd in fancy, rich, not gaudy,"
"32991","Hamlet","8","1.3.75","LORD POLONIUS","For the apparel oft proclaims the man,"
"32992","Hamlet","8","1.3.76","LORD POLONIUS","And they in France of the best rank and station"
"32993","Hamlet","8","1.3.77","LORD POLONIUS","Are of a most select and generous chief in that."
"32994","Hamlet","8","1.3.78","LORD POLONIUS","Neither a borrower nor a lender be,"
"32995","Hamlet","8","1.3.79","LORD POLONIUS","For loan oft loses both itself and friend,"
"32996","Hamlet","8","1.3.80","LORD POLONIUS","And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry."
"32997","Hamlet","8","1.3.81","LORD POLONIUS","This above all: to thine ownself be true,"
"32998","Hamlet","8","1.3.82","LORD POLONIUS","And it must follow, as the night the day,"
"32999","Hamlet","8","1.3.83","LORD POLONIUS","Thou canst not then be false to any man."
"33000","Hamlet","8","1.3.84","LORD POLONIUS","Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!"
"33001","Hamlet","9","1.3.85","LAERTES","Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord."
"33002","Hamlet","10","1.3.86","LORD POLONIUS","The time invites you, go, your servants tend."
"33003","Hamlet","11","1.3.87","LAERTES","Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well"
"33004","Hamlet","11","1.3.88","LAERTES","What I have said to you."
"33005","Hamlet","12","1.3.89","OPHELIA","'Tis in my memory lock'd,"
"33006","Hamlet","12","1.3.90","OPHELIA","And you yourself shall keep the key of it."
"33007","Hamlet","13","1.3.91","LAERTES","Farewell."
"33008","Hamlet","13",,"LAERTES","Exit"
"33009","Hamlet","14","1.3.92","LORD POLONIUS","What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?"
"33010","Hamlet","15","1.3.93","OPHELIA","So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet."
"33011","Hamlet","16","1.3.94","LORD POLONIUS","Marry, well bethought:"
"33012","Hamlet","16","1.3.95","LORD POLONIUS","'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late"
"33013","Hamlet","16","1.3.96","LORD POLONIUS","Given private time to you, and you yourself"
"33014","Hamlet","16","1.3.97","LORD POLONIUS","Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:"
"33015","Hamlet","16","1.3.98","LORD POLONIUS","If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,"
"33016","Hamlet","16","1.3.99","LORD POLONIUS","And that in way of caution, I must tell you,"
"33017","Hamlet","16","1.3.100","LORD POLONIUS","You do not understand yourself so clearly"
"33018","Hamlet","16","1.3.101","LORD POLONIUS","As it behoves my daughter and your honour."
"33019","Hamlet","16","1.3.102","LORD POLONIUS","What is between you? give me up the truth."
"33020","Hamlet","17","1.3.103","OPHELIA","He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders"
"33021","Hamlet","17","1.3.104","OPHELIA","Of his affection to me."
"33022","Hamlet","18","1.3.105","LORD POLONIUS","Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,"
"33023","Hamlet","18","1.3.106","LORD POLONIUS","Unsifted in such perilous circumstance."
"33024","Hamlet","18","1.3.107","LORD POLONIUS","Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?"
"33025","Hamlet","19","1.3.108","OPHELIA","I do not know, my lord, what I should think."
"33026","Hamlet","20","1.3.109","LORD POLONIUS","Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby,"
"33027","Hamlet","20","1.3.110","LORD POLONIUS","That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,"
"33028","Hamlet","20","1.3.111","LORD POLONIUS","Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,"
"33029","Hamlet","20","1.3.112","LORD POLONIUS","Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,"
"33030","Hamlet","20","1.3.113","LORD POLONIUS","Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool."
"33031","Hamlet","21","1.3.114","OPHELIA","My lord, he hath importuned me with love"
"33032","Hamlet","21","1.3.115","OPHELIA","In honourable fashion."
"33033","Hamlet","22","1.3.116","LORD POLONIUS","Ay, fashion you may call it, go to, go to."
"33034","Hamlet","23","1.3.117","OPHELIA","And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,"
"33035","Hamlet","23","1.3.118","OPHELIA","With almost all the holy vows of heaven."
"33036","Hamlet","24","1.3.119","LORD POLONIUS","Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,"
"33037","Hamlet","24","1.3.120","LORD POLONIUS","When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul"
"33038","Hamlet","24","1.3.121","LORD POLONIUS","Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,"
"33039","Hamlet","24","1.3.122","LORD POLONIUS","Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,"
"33040","Hamlet","24","1.3.123","LORD POLONIUS","Even in their promise, as it is a-making,"
"33041","Hamlet","24","1.3.124","LORD POLONIUS","You must not take for fire. From this time"
"33042","Hamlet","24","1.3.125","LORD POLONIUS","Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence,"
"33043","Hamlet","24","1.3.126","LORD POLONIUS","Set your entreatments at a higher rate"
"33044","Hamlet","24","1.3.127","LORD POLONIUS","Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,"
"33045","Hamlet","24","1.3.128","LORD POLONIUS","Believe so much in him, that he is young"
"33046","Hamlet","24","1.3.129","LORD POLONIUS","And with a larger tether may he walk"
"33047","Hamlet","24","1.3.130","LORD POLONIUS","Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,"
"33048","Hamlet","24","1.3.131","LORD POLONIUS","Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers,"
"33049","Hamlet","24","1.3.132","LORD POLONIUS","Not of that dye which their investments show,"
"33050","Hamlet","24","1.3.133","LORD POLONIUS","But mere implorators of unholy suits,"
"33051","Hamlet","24","1.3.134","LORD POLONIUS","Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,"
"33052","Hamlet","24","1.3.135","LORD POLONIUS","The better to beguile. This is for all:"
"33053","Hamlet","24","1.3.136","LORD POLONIUS","I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,"
"33054","Hamlet","24","1.3.137","LORD POLONIUS","Have you so slander any moment leisure,"
"33055","Hamlet","24","1.3.138","LORD POLONIUS","As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet."
"33056","Hamlet","24","1.3.139","LORD POLONIUS","Look to't, I charge you: come your ways."
"33057","Hamlet","25","1.3.140","OPHELIA","I shall obey, my lord."
"33058","Hamlet","25",,"OPHELIA","Exeunt"
"33059","Hamlet","25",,"OPHELIA","SCENE IV. The platform."
"33060","Hamlet","25",,"OPHELIA","Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS"
"33061","Hamlet","1","1.4.1","HAMLET","The air bites shrewdly, it is very cold."
"33062","Hamlet","2","1.4.2","HORATIO","It is a nipping and an eager air."
"33063","Hamlet","3","1.4.3","HAMLET","What hour now?"
"33064","Hamlet","4","1.4.4","HORATIO","I think it lacks of twelve."
"33065","Hamlet","5","1.4.5","HAMLET","No, it is struck."
"33066","Hamlet","6","1.4.6","HORATIO","Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season"
"33067","Hamlet","6","1.4.7","HORATIO","Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk."
"33068","Hamlet","6",,"HORATIO","A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within"
"33069","Hamlet","6","1.4.8","HORATIO","What does this mean, my lord?"
"33070","Hamlet","7","1.4.9","HAMLET","The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,"
"33071","Hamlet","7","1.4.10","HAMLET","Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels,"
"33072","Hamlet","7","1.4.11","HAMLET","And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,"
"33073","Hamlet","7","1.4.12","HAMLET","The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out"
"33074","Hamlet","7","1.4.13","HAMLET","The triumph of his pledge."
"33075","Hamlet","8","1.4.14","HORATIO","Is it a custom?"
"33076","Hamlet","9","1.4.15","HAMLET","Ay, marry, is't:"
"33077","Hamlet","9","1.4.16","HAMLET","But to my mind, though I am native here"
"33078","Hamlet","9","1.4.17","HAMLET","And to the manner born, it is a custom"
"33079","Hamlet","9","1.4.18","HAMLET","More honour'd in the breach than the observance."
"33080","Hamlet","9","1.4.19","HAMLET","This heavy-headed revel east and west"
"33081","Hamlet","9","1.4.20","HAMLET","Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:"
"33082","Hamlet","9","1.4.21","HAMLET","They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase"
"33083","Hamlet","9","1.4.22","HAMLET","Soil our addition, and indeed it takes"
"33084","Hamlet","9","1.4.23","HAMLET","From our achievements, though perform'd at height,"
"33085","Hamlet","9","1.4.24","HAMLET","The pith and marrow of our attribute."
"33086","Hamlet","9","1.4.25","HAMLET","So, oft it chances in particular men,"
"33087","Hamlet","9","1.4.26","HAMLET","That for some vicious mole of nature in them,"
"33088","Hamlet","9","1.4.27","HAMLET","As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,"
"33089","Hamlet","9","1.4.28","HAMLET","Since nature cannot choose his origin--"
"33090","Hamlet","9","1.4.29","HAMLET","By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,"
"33091","Hamlet","9","1.4.30","HAMLET","Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,"
"33092","Hamlet","9","1.4.31","HAMLET","Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens"
"33093","Hamlet","9","1.4.32","HAMLET","The form of plausive manners, that these men,"
"33094","Hamlet","9","1.4.33","HAMLET","Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,"
"33095","Hamlet","9","1.4.34","HAMLET","Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--"
"33096","Hamlet","9","1.4.35","HAMLET","Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,"
"33097","Hamlet","9","1.4.36","HAMLET","As infinite as man may undergo--"
"33098","Hamlet","9","1.4.37","HAMLET","Shall in the general censure take corruption"
"33099","Hamlet","9","1.4.38","HAMLET","From that particular fault: the dram of eale"
"33100","Hamlet","9","1.4.39","HAMLET","Doth all the noble substance of a doubt"
"33101","Hamlet","9","1.4.40","HAMLET","To his own scandal."
"33102","Hamlet","10","1.4.41","HORATIO","Look, my lord, it comes!"

"33107","Hamlet","11","1.4.45","HAMLET","Be thy intents wicked or charitable,"
"33108","Hamlet","11","1.4.46","HAMLET","Thou comest in such a questionable shape"
"33109","Hamlet","11","1.4.47","HAMLET","That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,"
"33110","Hamlet","11","1.4.48","HAMLET","King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!"
"33111","Hamlet","11","1.4.49","HAMLET","Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell"
"33112","Hamlet","11","1.4.50","HAMLET","Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,"
"33113","Hamlet","11","1.4.51","HAMLET","Have burst their cerements, why the sepulchre,"
"33114","Hamlet","11","1.4.52","HAMLET","Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,"
"33115","Hamlet","11","1.4.53","HAMLET","Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,"
"33116","Hamlet","11","1.4.54","HAMLET","To cast thee up again. What may this mean,"
"33117","Hamlet","11","1.4.55","HAMLET","That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel"
"33118","Hamlet","11","1.4.56","HAMLET","Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,"
"33119","Hamlet","11","1.4.57","HAMLET","Making night hideous, and we fools of nature"
"33120","Hamlet","11","1.4.58","HAMLET","So horridly to shake our disposition"
"33121","Hamlet","11","1.4.59","HAMLET","With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?"
"33122","Hamlet","11","1.4.60","HAMLET","Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?"
"33123","Hamlet","11",,"HAMLET","Ghost beckons HAMLET"
"33124","Hamlet","12","1.4.61","HORATIO","It beckons you to go away with it,"
"33125","Hamlet","12","1.4.62","HORATIO","As if it some impartment did desire"
"33126","Hamlet","12","1.4.63","HORATIO","To you alone."
"33127","Hamlet","13","1.4.64","MARCELLUS","Look, with what courteous action"
"33128","Hamlet","13","1.4.65","MARCELLUS","It waves you to a more removed ground:"
"33129","Hamlet","13","1.4.66","MARCELLUS","But do not go with it."
"33130","Hamlet","14","1.4.67","HORATIO","No, by no means."
"33131","Hamlet","15","1.4.68","HAMLET","It will not speak, then I will follow it."
"33132","Hamlet","16","1.4.69","HORATIO","Do not, my lord."
"33133","Hamlet","17","1.4.70","HAMLET","Why, what should be the fear?"
"33134","Hamlet","17","1.4.71","HAMLET","I do not set my life in a pin's fee,"
"33135","Hamlet","17","1.4.72","HAMLET","And for my soul, what can it do to that,"
"33136","Hamlet","17","1.4.73","HAMLET","Being a thing immortal as itself?"
"33137","Hamlet","17","1.4.74","HAMLET","It waves me forth again: I'll follow it."
"33138","Hamlet","18","1.4.75","HORATIO","What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,"
"33139","Hamlet","18","1.4.76","HORATIO","Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff"
"33140","Hamlet","18","1.4.77","HORATIO","That beetles o'er his base into the sea,"
"33141","Hamlet","18","1.4.78","HORATIO","And there assume some other horrible form,"

"33175","Hamlet","5","1.5.7","HAMLET","Alas, poor ghost!"
"33176","Hamlet","6","1.5.8","Ghost","Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing"
"33177","Hamlet","6","1.5.9","Ghost","To what I shall unfold."
"33178","Hamlet","7","1.5.10","HAMLET","Speak, I am bound to hear."
"33179","Hamlet","8","1.5.11","Ghost","So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear."
"33180","Hamlet","9","1.5.12","HAMLET","What?"
"33181","Hamlet","10","1.5.13","Ghost","I am thy father's spirit,"
"33182","Hamlet","10","1.5.14","Ghost","Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,"
"33183","Hamlet","10","1.5.15","Ghost","And for the day confined to fast in fires,"
"33184","Hamlet","10","1.5.16","Ghost","Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature"
"33185","Hamlet","10","1.5.17","Ghost","Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid"
"33186","Hamlet","10","1.5.18","Ghost","To tell the secrets of my prison-house,"
"33187","Hamlet","10","1.5.19","Ghost","I could a tale unfold whose lightest word"

"33190","Hamlet","10","1.5.22","Ghost","Thy knotted and combined locks to part"
"33191","Hamlet","10","1.5.23","Ghost","And each particular hair to stand on end,"
"33192","Hamlet","10","1.5.24","Ghost","Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:"

"33201","Hamlet","15","1.5.33","HAMLET","Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift"

"33206","Hamlet","16","1.5.38","Ghost","That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,"
"33207","Hamlet","16","1.5.39","Ghost","Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:"
"33208","Hamlet","16","1.5.40","Ghost","'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,"
"33209","Hamlet","16","1.5.41","Ghost","A serpent stung me, so the whole ear of Denmark"
"33210","Hamlet","16","1.5.42","Ghost","Is by a forged process of my death"

"33215","Hamlet","18","1.5.47","Ghost","Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,"
"33216","Hamlet","18","1.5.48","Ghost","With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--"
"33217","Hamlet","18","1.5.49","Ghost","O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power"
"33218","Hamlet","18","1.5.50","Ghost","So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust"
"33219","Hamlet","18","1.5.51","Ghost","The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:"
"33220","Hamlet","18","1.5.52","Ghost","O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!"
"33221","Hamlet","18","1.5.53","Ghost","From me, whose love was of that dignity"
"33222","Hamlet","18","1.5.54","Ghost","That it went hand in hand even with the vow"
"33223","Hamlet","18","1.5.55","Ghost","I made to her in marriage, and to decline"
"33224","Hamlet","18","1.5.56","Ghost","Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor"
"33225","Hamlet","18","1.5.57","Ghost","To those of mine!"
"33226","Hamlet","18","1.5.58","Ghost","But virtue, as it never will be moved,"
"33227","Hamlet","18","1.5.59","Ghost","Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,"
"33228","Hamlet","18","1.5.60","Ghost","So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,"
"33229","Hamlet","18","1.5.61","Ghost","Will sate itself in a celestial bed,"
"33230","Hamlet","18","1.5.62","Ghost","And prey on garbage."
"33231","Hamlet","18","1.5.63","Ghost","But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air,"
"33232","Hamlet","18","1.5.64","Ghost","Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,"
"33233","Hamlet","18","1.5.65","Ghost","My custom always of the afternoon,"
"33234","Hamlet","18","1.5.66","Ghost","Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,"
"33235","Hamlet","18","1.5.67","Ghost","With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,"
"33236","Hamlet","18","1.5.68","Ghost","And in the porches of my ears did pour"
"33237","Hamlet","18","1.5.69","Ghost","The leperous distilment, whose effect"
"33238","Hamlet","18","1.5.70","Ghost","Holds such an enmity with blood of man"
"33239","Hamlet","18","1.5.71","Ghost","That swift as quicksilver it courses through"
"33240","Hamlet","18","1.5.72","Ghost","The natural gates and alleys of the body,"
"33241","Hamlet","18","1.5.73","Ghost","And with a sudden vigour doth posset"
"33242","Hamlet","18","1.5.74","Ghost","And curd, like eager droppings into milk,"
"33243","Hamlet","18","1.5.75","Ghost","The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine,"
"33244","Hamlet","18","1.5.76","Ghost","And a most instant tetter bark'd about,"
"33245","Hamlet","18","1.5.77","Ghost","Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,"
"33246","Hamlet","18","1.5.78","Ghost","All my smooth body."
"33247","Hamlet","18","1.5.79","Ghost","Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand"
"33248","Hamlet","18","1.5.80","Ghost","Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:"
"33249","Hamlet","18","1.5.81","Ghost","Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,"
"33250","Hamlet","18","1.5.82","Ghost","Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,"
"33251","Hamlet","18","1.5.83","Ghost","No reckoning made, but sent to my account"
"33252","Hamlet","18","1.5.84","Ghost","With all my imperfections on my head:"
"33253","Hamlet","18","1.5.85","Ghost","O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!"
"33254","Hamlet","18","1.5.86","Ghost","If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not,"
"33255","Hamlet","18","1.5.87","Ghost","Let not the royal bed of Denmark be"
"33256","Hamlet","18","1.5.88","Ghost","A couch for luxury and damned incest."
"33257","Hamlet","18","1.5.89","Ghost","But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,"
"33258","Hamlet","18","1.5.90","Ghost","Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive"
"33259","Hamlet","18","1.5.91","Ghost","Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven"
"33260","Hamlet","18","1.5.92","Ghost","And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,"
"33261","Hamlet","18","1.5.93","Ghost","To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!"
"33262","Hamlet","18","1.5.94","Ghost","The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,"
"33263","Hamlet","18","1.5.95","Ghost","And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:"

"33266","Hamlet","19","1.5.97","HAMLET","O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?"
"33267","Hamlet","19","1.5.98","HAMLET","And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart,"
"33268","Hamlet","19","1.5.99","HAMLET","And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,"
"33269","Hamlet","19","1.5.100","HAMLET","But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!"
"33270","Hamlet","19","1.5.101","HAMLET","Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat"
"33271","Hamlet","19","1.5.102","HAMLET","In this distracted globe. Remember thee!"
"33272","Hamlet","19","1.5.103","HAMLET","Yea, from the table of my memory"
"33273","Hamlet","19","1.5.104","HAMLET","I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,"
"33274","Hamlet","19","1.5.105","HAMLET","All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,"
"33275","Hamlet","19","1.5.106","HAMLET","That youth and observation copied there,"
"33276","Hamlet","19","1.5.107","HAMLET","And thy commandment all alone shall live"

"33279","Hamlet","19","1.5.110","HAMLET","O most pernicious woman!"
"33280","Hamlet","19","1.5.111","HAMLET","O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!"
"33281","Hamlet","19","1.5.112","HAMLET","My tables,--meet it is I set it down,"
"33282","Hamlet","19","1.5.113","HAMLET","That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain,"
"33283","Hamlet","19","1.5.114","HAMLET","At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:"

"33297","Hamlet","29","1.5.126","HAMLET","O, wonderful!"
"33298","Hamlet","30","1.5.127","HORATIO","Good my lord, tell it."
"33299","Hamlet","31","1.5.128","HAMLET","No, you'll reveal it."

"33388","Hamlet","3","2.1.3","LORD POLONIUS","You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,"
"33389","Hamlet","3","2.1.4","LORD POLONIUS","Before you visit him, to make inquire"
"33390","Hamlet","3","2.1.5","LORD POLONIUS","Of his behavior."
"33391","Hamlet","4","2.1.6","REYNALDO","My lord, I did intend it."
"33392","Hamlet","5","2.1.7","LORD POLONIUS","Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,"
"33393","Hamlet","5","2.1.8","LORD POLONIUS","Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris,"
"33394","Hamlet","5","2.1.9","LORD POLONIUS","And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,"
"33395","Hamlet","5","2.1.10","LORD POLONIUS","What company, at what expense, and finding"
"33396","Hamlet","5","2.1.11","LORD POLONIUS","By this encompassment and drift of question"
"33397","Hamlet","5","2.1.12","LORD POLONIUS","That they do know my son, come you more nearer"
"33398","Hamlet","5","2.1.13","LORD POLONIUS","Than your particular demands will touch it:"
"33399","Hamlet","5","2.1.14","LORD POLONIUS","Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him,"
"33400","Hamlet","5","2.1.15","LORD POLONIUS","As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,"
"33401","Hamlet","5","2.1.16","LORD POLONIUS","And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?"
"33402","Hamlet","6","2.1.17","REYNALDO","Ay, very well, my lord."
"33403","Hamlet","7","2.1.18","LORD POLONIUS","'And in part him, but' you may say 'not well:"
"33404","Hamlet","7","2.1.19","LORD POLONIUS","But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild,"
"33405","Hamlet","7","2.1.20","LORD POLONIUS","Addicted so and so:' and there put on him"
"33406","Hamlet","7","2.1.21","LORD POLONIUS","What forgeries you please, marry, none so rank"
"33407","Hamlet","7","2.1.22","LORD POLONIUS","As may dishonour him, take heed of that,"
"33408","Hamlet","7","2.1.23","LORD POLONIUS","But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips"
"33409","Hamlet","7","2.1.24","LORD POLONIUS","As are companions noted and most known"
"33410","Hamlet","7","2.1.25","LORD POLONIUS","To youth and liberty."
"33411","Hamlet","8","2.1.26","REYNALDO","As gaming, my lord."
"33412","Hamlet","9","2.1.27","LORD POLONIUS","Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,"
"33413","Hamlet","9","2.1.28","LORD POLONIUS","Drabbing: you may go so far."
"33414","Hamlet","10","2.1.29","REYNALDO","My lord, that would dishonour him."
"33415","Hamlet","11","2.1.30","LORD POLONIUS","'Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge"
"33416","Hamlet","11","2.1.31","LORD POLONIUS","You must not put another scandal on him,"
"33417","Hamlet","11","2.1.32","LORD POLONIUS","That he is open to incontinency,"
"33418","Hamlet","11","2.1.33","LORD POLONIUS","That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly"
"33419","Hamlet","11","2.1.34","LORD POLONIUS","That they may seem the taints of liberty,"
"33420","Hamlet","11","2.1.35","LORD POLONIUS","The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,"
"33421","Hamlet","11","2.1.36","LORD POLONIUS","A savageness in unreclaimed blood,"
"33422","Hamlet","11","2.1.37","LORD POLONIUS","Of general assault."
"33423","Hamlet","12","2.1.38","REYNALDO","But, my good lord,--"
"33424","Hamlet","13","2.1.39","LORD POLONIUS","Wherefore should you do this?"
"33425","Hamlet","14","2.1.40","REYNALDO","Ay, my lord,"
"33426","Hamlet","14","2.1.41","REYNALDO","I would know that."
"33427","Hamlet","15","2.1.42","LORD POLONIUS","Marry, sir, here's my drift,"
"33428","Hamlet","15","2.1.43","LORD POLONIUS","And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:"
"33429","Hamlet","15","2.1.44","LORD POLONIUS","You laying these slight sullies on my son,"
"33430","Hamlet","15","2.1.45","LORD POLONIUS","As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,"
"33431","Hamlet","15","2.1.46","LORD POLONIUS","Your party in converse, him you would sound,"
"33432","Hamlet","15","2.1.47","LORD POLONIUS","Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes"
"33433","Hamlet","15","2.1.48","LORD POLONIUS","The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured"
"33434","Hamlet","15","2.1.49","LORD POLONIUS","He closes with you in this consequence,"
"33435","Hamlet","15","2.1.50","LORD POLONIUS","'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'"
"33436","Hamlet","15","2.1.51","LORD POLONIUS","According to the phrase or the addition"
"33437","Hamlet","15","2.1.52","LORD POLONIUS","Of man and country."
"33438","Hamlet","16","2.1.53","REYNALDO","Very good, my lord."
"33439","Hamlet","17","2.1.54","LORD POLONIUS","And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I"
"33440","Hamlet","17","2.1.55","LORD POLONIUS","about to say? By the mass, I was about to say"
"33441","Hamlet","17","2.1.56","LORD POLONIUS","something: where did I leave?"
"33442","Hamlet","18","2.1.57","REYNALDO","At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'"
"33443","Hamlet","18","2.1.58","REYNALDO","and 'gentleman.'"
"33444","Hamlet","19","2.1.59","LORD POLONIUS","At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry,"
"33445","Hamlet","19","2.1.60","LORD POLONIUS","He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman,"
"33446","Hamlet","19","2.1.61","LORD POLONIUS","I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,"
"33447","Hamlet","19","2.1.62","LORD POLONIUS","Or then, or then, with such, or such, and, as you say,"
"33448","Hamlet","19","2.1.63","LORD POLONIUS","There was a' gaming, there o'ertook in's rouse,"
"33449","Hamlet","19","2.1.64","LORD POLONIUS","There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,"
"33450","Hamlet","19","2.1.65","LORD POLONIUS","'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'"
"33451","Hamlet","19","2.1.66","LORD POLONIUS","Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth."
"33452","Hamlet","19","2.1.67","LORD POLONIUS","See you now,"
"33453","Hamlet","19","2.1.68","LORD POLONIUS","Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:"
"33454","Hamlet","19","2.1.69","LORD POLONIUS","And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,"
"33455","Hamlet","19","2.1.70","LORD POLONIUS","With windlasses and with assays of bias,"
"33456","Hamlet","19","2.1.71","LORD POLONIUS","By indirections find directions out:"
"33457","Hamlet","19","2.1.72","LORD POLONIUS","So by my former lecture and advice,"
"33458","Hamlet","19","2.1.73","LORD POLONIUS","Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?"
"33459","Hamlet","20","2.1.74","REYNALDO","My lord, I have."
"33460","Hamlet","21","2.1.75","LORD POLONIUS","God be wi' you, fare you well."
"33461","Hamlet","22","2.1.76","REYNALDO","Good my lord!"
"33462","Hamlet","23","2.1.77","LORD POLONIUS","Observe his inclination in yourself."
"33463","Hamlet","24","2.1.78","REYNALDO","I shall, my lord."
"33464","Hamlet","25","2.1.79","LORD POLONIUS","And let him ply his music."
"33465","Hamlet","26","2.1.80","REYNALDO","Well, my lord."
"33466","Hamlet","27","2.1.81","LORD POLONIUS","Farewell!"
"33467","Hamlet","27",,"LORD POLONIUS","Exit REYNALDO"
"33468","Hamlet","27",,"LORD POLONIUS","Enter OPHELIA"
"33469","Hamlet","27","2.1.82","LORD POLONIUS","How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?"
"33470","Hamlet","28","2.1.83","OPHELIA","O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!"
"33471","Hamlet","29","2.1.84","LORD POLONIUS","With what, i' the name of God?"
"33472","Hamlet","30","2.1.85","OPHELIA","My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,"
"33473","Hamlet","30","2.1.86","OPHELIA","Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced,"
"33474","Hamlet","30","2.1.87","OPHELIA","No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,"
"33475","Hamlet","30","2.1.88","OPHELIA","Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle,"
"33476","Hamlet","30","2.1.89","OPHELIA","Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,"
"33477","Hamlet","30","2.1.90","OPHELIA","And with a look so piteous in purport"
"33478","Hamlet","30","2.1.91","OPHELIA","As if he had been loosed out of hell"
"33479","Hamlet","30","2.1.92","OPHELIA","To speak of horrors,--he comes before me."
"33480","Hamlet","31","2.1.93","LORD POLONIUS","Mad for thy love?"
"33481","Hamlet","32","2.1.94","OPHELIA","My lord, I do not know,"
"33482","Hamlet","32","2.1.95","OPHELIA","But truly, I do fear it."
"33483","Hamlet","33","2.1.96","LORD POLONIUS","What said he?"
"33484","Hamlet","34","2.1.97","OPHELIA","He took me by the wrist and held me hard,"
"33485","Hamlet","34","2.1.98","OPHELIA","Then goes he to the length of all his arm,"
"33486","Hamlet","34","2.1.99","OPHELIA","And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,"
"33487","Hamlet","34","2.1.100","OPHELIA","He falls to such perusal of my face"
"33488","Hamlet","34","2.1.101","OPHELIA","As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so,"
"33489","Hamlet","34","2.1.102","OPHELIA","At last, a little shaking of mine arm"
"33490","Hamlet","34","2.1.103","OPHELIA","And thrice his head thus waving up and down,"
"33491","Hamlet","34","2.1.104","OPHELIA","He raised a sigh so piteous and profound"
"33492","Hamlet","34","2.1.105","OPHELIA","As it did seem to shatter all his bulk"
"33493","Hamlet","34","2.1.106","OPHELIA","And end his being: that done, he lets me go:"
"33494","Hamlet","34","2.1.107","OPHELIA","And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,"
"33495","Hamlet","34","2.1.108","OPHELIA","He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,"
"33496","Hamlet","34","2.1.109","OPHELIA","For out o' doors he went without their helps,"
"33497","Hamlet","34","2.1.110","OPHELIA","And, to the last, bended their light on me."
"33498","Hamlet","35","2.1.111","LORD POLONIUS","Come, go with me: I will go seek the king."
"33499","Hamlet","35","2.1.112","LORD POLONIUS","This is the very ecstasy of love,"
"33500","Hamlet","35","2.1.113","LORD POLONIUS","Whose violent property fordoes itself"
"33501","Hamlet","35","2.1.114","LORD POLONIUS","And leads the will to desperate undertakings"
"33502","Hamlet","35","2.1.115","LORD POLONIUS","As oft as any passion under heaven"
"33503","Hamlet","35","2.1.116","LORD POLONIUS","That does afflict our natures. I am sorry."
"33504","Hamlet","35","2.1.117","LORD POLONIUS","What, have you given him any hard words of late?"
"33505","Hamlet","36","2.1.118","OPHELIA","No, my good lord, but, as you did command,"
"33506","Hamlet","36","2.1.119","OPHELIA","I did repel his fetters and denied"
"33507","Hamlet","36","2.1.120","OPHELIA","His access to me."
"33508","Hamlet","37","2.1.121","LORD POLONIUS","That hath made him mad."
"33509","Hamlet","37","2.1.122","LORD POLONIUS","I am sorry that with better heed and judgment"
"33510","Hamlet","37","2.1.123","LORD POLONIUS","I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,"
"33511","Hamlet","37","2.1.124","LORD POLONIUS","And meant to wreck thee, but, beshrew my jealousy!"
"33512","Hamlet","37","2.1.125","LORD POLONIUS","By heaven, it is as proper to our age"
"33513","Hamlet","37","2.1.126","LORD POLONIUS","To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions"
"33514","Hamlet","37","2.1.127","LORD POLONIUS","As it is common for the younger sort"
"33515","Hamlet","37","2.1.128","LORD POLONIUS","To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:"
"33516","Hamlet","37","2.1.129","LORD POLONIUS","This must be known, which, being kept close, might"
"33517","Hamlet","37","2.1.130","LORD POLONIUS","move"
"33518","Hamlet","37","2.1.131","LORD POLONIUS","More grief to hide than hate to utter love."

"33520","Hamlet","37",,"LORD POLONIUS","SCENE II. A room in the castle."
"33521","Hamlet","37",,"LORD POLONIUS","Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants"
"33522","Hamlet","1","2.2.1","KING CLAUDIUS","Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!"
"33523","Hamlet","1","2.2.2","KING CLAUDIUS","Moreover that we much did long to see you,"
"33524","Hamlet","1","2.2.3","KING CLAUDIUS","The need we have to use you did provoke"
"33525","Hamlet","1","2.2.4","KING CLAUDIUS","Our hasty sending. Something have you heard"
"33526","Hamlet","1","2.2.5","KING CLAUDIUS","Of Hamlet's transformation, so call it,"
"33527","Hamlet","1","2.2.6","KING CLAUDIUS","Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man"
"33528","Hamlet","1","2.2.7","KING CLAUDIUS","Resembles that it was. What it should be,"
"33529","Hamlet","1","2.2.8","KING CLAUDIUS","More than his father's death, that thus hath put him"
"33530","Hamlet","1","2.2.9","KING CLAUDIUS","So much from the understanding of himself,"
"33531","Hamlet","1","2.2.10","KING CLAUDIUS","I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,"
"33532","Hamlet","1","2.2.11","KING CLAUDIUS","That, being of so young days brought up with him,"
"33533","Hamlet","1","2.2.12","KING CLAUDIUS","And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,"
"33534","Hamlet","1","2.2.13","KING CLAUDIUS","That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court"
"33535","Hamlet","1","2.2.14","KING CLAUDIUS","Some little time: so by your companies"
"33536","Hamlet","1","2.2.15","KING CLAUDIUS","To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,"
"33537","Hamlet","1","2.2.16","KING CLAUDIUS","So much as from occasion you may glean,"
"33538","Hamlet","1","2.2.17","KING CLAUDIUS","Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,"
"33539","Hamlet","1","2.2.18","KING CLAUDIUS","That, open'd, lies within our remedy."
"33540","Hamlet","2","2.2.19","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,"
"33541","Hamlet","2","2.2.20","QUEEN GERTRUDE","And sure I am two men there are not living"
"33542","Hamlet","2","2.2.21","QUEEN GERTRUDE","To whom he more adheres. If it will please you"
"33543","Hamlet","2","2.2.22","QUEEN GERTRUDE","To show us so much gentry and good will"
"33544","Hamlet","2","2.2.23","QUEEN GERTRUDE","As to expend your time with us awhile,"
"33545","Hamlet","2","2.2.24","QUEEN GERTRUDE","For the supply and profit of our hope,"
"33546","Hamlet","2","2.2.25","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Your visitation shall receive such thanks"
"33547","Hamlet","2","2.2.26","QUEEN GERTRUDE","As fits a king's remembrance."
"33548","Hamlet","3","2.2.27","ROSENCRANTZ","Both your majesties"
"33549","Hamlet","3","2.2.28","ROSENCRANTZ","Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,"
"33550","Hamlet","3","2.2.29","ROSENCRANTZ","Put your dread pleasures more into command"
"33551","Hamlet","3","2.2.30","ROSENCRANTZ","Than to entreaty."
"33552","Hamlet","4","2.2.31","GUILDENSTERN","But we both obey,"
"33553","Hamlet","4","2.2.32","GUILDENSTERN","And here give up ourselves, in the full bent"

"33571","Hamlet","11","2.2.48","LORD POLONIUS","Both to my God and to my gracious king:"
"33572","Hamlet","11","2.2.49","LORD POLONIUS","And I do think, or else this brain of mine"
"33573","Hamlet","11","2.2.50","LORD POLONIUS","Hunts not the trail of policy so sure"
"33574","Hamlet","11","2.2.51","LORD POLONIUS","As it hath used to do, that I have found"
"33575","Hamlet","11","2.2.52","LORD POLONIUS","The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy."
"33576","Hamlet","12","2.2.53","KING CLAUDIUS","O, speak of that, that do I long to hear."
"33577","Hamlet","13","2.2.54","LORD POLONIUS","Give first admittance to the ambassadors,"
"33578","Hamlet","13","2.2.55","LORD POLONIUS","My news shall be the fruit to that great feast."

"33582","Hamlet","14","2.2.58","KING CLAUDIUS","The head and source of all your son's distemper."
"33583","Hamlet","15","2.2.59","QUEEN GERTRUDE","I doubt it is no other but the main,"
"33584","Hamlet","15","2.2.60","QUEEN GERTRUDE","His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage."
"33585","Hamlet","16","2.2.61","KING CLAUDIUS","Well, we shall sift him."
"33586","Hamlet","16",,"KING CLAUDIUS","Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS"

"33589","Hamlet","17","2.2.64","VOLTIMAND","Most fair return of greetings and desires."
"33590","Hamlet","17","2.2.65","VOLTIMAND","Upon our first, he sent out to suppress"

"33592","Hamlet","17","2.2.67","VOLTIMAND","To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,"

"33594","Hamlet","17","2.2.69","VOLTIMAND","It was against your highness: whereat grieved,"
"33595","Hamlet","17","2.2.70","VOLTIMAND","That so his sickness, age and impotence"
"33596","Hamlet","17","2.2.71","VOLTIMAND","Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests"

"33609","Hamlet","17","2.2.83","VOLTIMAND","On such regards of safety and allowance"
"33610","Hamlet","17","2.2.84","VOLTIMAND","As therein are set down."
"33611","Hamlet","18","2.2.85","KING CLAUDIUS","It likes us well,"

"33617","Hamlet","18",,"KING CLAUDIUS","Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS"
"33618","Hamlet","19","2.2.91","LORD POLONIUS","This business is well ended."
"33619","Hamlet","19","2.2.92","LORD POLONIUS","My liege, and madam, to expostulate"
"33620","Hamlet","19","2.2.93","LORD POLONIUS","What majesty should be, what duty is,"
"33621","Hamlet","19","2.2.94","LORD POLONIUS","Why day is day, night night, and time is time,"
"33622","Hamlet","19","2.2.95","LORD POLONIUS","Were nothing but to waste night, day and time."
"33623","Hamlet","19","2.2.96","LORD POLONIUS","Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,"
"33624","Hamlet","19","2.2.97","LORD POLONIUS","And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,"
"33625","Hamlet","19","2.2.98","LORD POLONIUS","I will be brief: your noble son is mad:"
"33626","Hamlet","19","2.2.99","LORD POLONIUS","Mad call I it, for, to define true madness,"
"33627","Hamlet","19","2.2.100","LORD POLONIUS","What is't but to be nothing else but mad?"
"33628","Hamlet","19","2.2.101","LORD POLONIUS","But let that go."
"33629","Hamlet","20","2.2.102","QUEEN GERTRUDE","More matter, with less art."
"33630","Hamlet","21","2.2.103","LORD POLONIUS","Madam, I swear I use no art at all."
"33631","Hamlet","21","2.2.104","LORD POLONIUS","That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity,"
"33632","Hamlet","21","2.2.105","LORD POLONIUS","And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure,"
"33633","Hamlet","21","2.2.106","LORD POLONIUS","But farewell it, for I will use no art."
"33634","Hamlet","21","2.2.107","LORD POLONIUS","Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains"
"33635","Hamlet","21","2.2.108","LORD POLONIUS","That we find out the cause of this effect,"
"33636","Hamlet","21","2.2.109","LORD POLONIUS","Or rather say, the cause of this defect,"
"33637","Hamlet","21","2.2.110","LORD POLONIUS","For this effect defective comes by cause:"
"33638","Hamlet","21","2.2.111","LORD POLONIUS","Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend."
"33639","Hamlet","21","2.2.112","LORD POLONIUS","I have a daughter--have while she is mine--"
"33640","Hamlet","21","2.2.113","LORD POLONIUS","Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,"
"33641","Hamlet","21","2.2.114","LORD POLONIUS","Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise."
"33642","Hamlet","21",,"LORD POLONIUS","Reads"
"33643","Hamlet","21","2.2.115","LORD POLONIUS","'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most"
"33644","Hamlet","21","2.2.116","LORD POLONIUS","beautified Ophelia,'--"
"33645","Hamlet","21","2.2.117","LORD POLONIUS","That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase, 'beautified' is"
"33646","Hamlet","21","2.2.118","LORD POLONIUS","a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:"
"33647","Hamlet","21",,"LORD POLONIUS","Reads"
"33648","Hamlet","21","2.2.119","LORD POLONIUS","'In her excellent white bosom, these,  and c.'"
"33649","Hamlet","22","2.2.120","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Came this from Hamlet to her?"
"33650","Hamlet","23","2.2.121","LORD POLONIUS","Good madam, stay awhile, I will be faithful."
"33651","Hamlet","23",,"LORD POLONIUS","Reads"
"33652","Hamlet","23","2.2.122","LORD POLONIUS","'Doubt thou the stars are fire,"
"33653","Hamlet","23","2.2.123","LORD POLONIUS","Doubt that the sun doth move,"
"33654","Hamlet","23","2.2.124","LORD POLONIUS","Doubt truth to be a liar,"
"33655","Hamlet","23","2.2.125","LORD POLONIUS","But never doubt I love."
"33656","Hamlet","23","2.2.126","LORD POLONIUS","'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers,"
"33657","Hamlet","23","2.2.127","LORD POLONIUS","I have not art to reckon my groans: but that"
"33658","Hamlet","23","2.2.128","LORD POLONIUS","I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu."
"33659","Hamlet","23","2.2.129","LORD POLONIUS","'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst"
"33660","Hamlet","23","2.2.130","LORD POLONIUS","this machine is to him, HAMLET.'"
"33661","Hamlet","23","2.2.131","LORD POLONIUS","This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,"
"33662","Hamlet","23","2.2.132","LORD POLONIUS","And more above, hath his solicitings,"
"33663","Hamlet","23","2.2.133","LORD POLONIUS","As they fell out by time, by means and place,"
"33664","Hamlet","23","2.2.134","LORD POLONIUS","All given to mine ear."
"33665","Hamlet","24","2.2.135","KING CLAUDIUS","But how hath she"
"33666","Hamlet","24","2.2.136","KING CLAUDIUS","Received his love?"
"33667","Hamlet","25","2.2.137","LORD POLONIUS","What do you think of me?"
"33668","Hamlet","26","2.2.138","KING CLAUDIUS","As of a man faithful and honourable."
"33669","Hamlet","27","2.2.139","LORD POLONIUS","I would fain prove so. But what might you think,"
"33670","Hamlet","27","2.2.140","LORD POLONIUS","When I had seen this hot love on the wing--"
"33671","Hamlet","27","2.2.141","LORD POLONIUS","As I perceived it, I must tell you that,"
"33672","Hamlet","27","2.2.142","LORD POLONIUS","Before my daughter told me--what might you,"
"33673","Hamlet","27","2.2.143","LORD POLONIUS","Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,"
"33674","Hamlet","27","2.2.144","LORD POLONIUS","If I had play'd the desk or table-book,"
"33675","Hamlet","27","2.2.145","LORD POLONIUS","Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,"
"33676","Hamlet","27","2.2.146","LORD POLONIUS","Or look'd upon this love with idle sight,"
"33677","Hamlet","27","2.2.147","LORD POLONIUS","What might you think? No, I went round to work,"
"33678","Hamlet","27","2.2.148","LORD POLONIUS","And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:"
"33679","Hamlet","27","2.2.149","LORD POLONIUS","'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star,"
"33680","Hamlet","27","2.2.150","LORD POLONIUS","This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,"
"33681","Hamlet","27","2.2.151","LORD POLONIUS","That she should lock herself from his resort,"
"33682","Hamlet","27","2.2.152","LORD POLONIUS","Admit no messengers, receive no tokens."
"33683","Hamlet","27","2.2.153","LORD POLONIUS","Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,"
"33684","Hamlet","27","2.2.154","LORD POLONIUS","And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--"
"33685","Hamlet","27","2.2.155","LORD POLONIUS","Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,"
"33686","Hamlet","27","2.2.156","LORD POLONIUS","Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,"
"33687","Hamlet","27","2.2.157","LORD POLONIUS","Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,"
"33688","Hamlet","27","2.2.158","LORD POLONIUS","Into the madness wherein now he raves,"
"33689","Hamlet","27","2.2.159","LORD POLONIUS","And all we mourn for."
"33690","Hamlet","28","2.2.160","KING CLAUDIUS","Do you think 'tis this?"
"33691","Hamlet","29","2.2.161","QUEEN GERTRUDE","It may be, very likely."
"33692","Hamlet","30","2.2.162","LORD POLONIUS","Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--"
"33693","Hamlet","30","2.2.163","LORD POLONIUS","That I have positively said 'Tis so,'"
"33694","Hamlet","30","2.2.164","LORD POLONIUS","When it proved otherwise?"
"33695","Hamlet","31","2.2.165","KING CLAUDIUS","Not that I know."
"33696","Hamlet","32","2.2.166","LORD POLONIUS","[Pointing to his head and shoulder]"
"33697","Hamlet","32","2.2.167","LORD POLONIUS","Take this from this, if this be otherwise:"
"33698","Hamlet","32","2.2.168","LORD POLONIUS","If circumstances lead me, I will find"
"33699","Hamlet","32","2.2.169","LORD POLONIUS","Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed"
"33700","Hamlet","32","2.2.170","LORD POLONIUS","Within the centre."
"33701","Hamlet","33","2.2.171","KING CLAUDIUS","How may we try it further?"
"33702","Hamlet","34","2.2.172","LORD POLONIUS","You know, sometimes he walks four hours together"
"33703","Hamlet","34","2.2.173","LORD POLONIUS","Here in the lobby."
"33704","Hamlet","35","2.2.174","QUEEN GERTRUDE","So he does indeed."
"33705","Hamlet","36","2.2.175","LORD POLONIUS","At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:"
"33706","Hamlet","36","2.2.176","LORD POLONIUS","Be you and I behind an arras then,"
"33707","Hamlet","36","2.2.177","LORD POLONIUS","Mark the encounter: if he love her not"
"33708","Hamlet","36","2.2.178","LORD POLONIUS","And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,"
"33709","Hamlet","36","2.2.179","LORD POLONIUS","Let me be no assistant for a state,"
"33710","Hamlet","36","2.2.180","LORD POLONIUS","But keep a farm and carters."
"33711","Hamlet","37","2.2.181","KING CLAUDIUS","We will try it."
"33712","Hamlet","38","2.2.182","QUEEN GERTRUDE","But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading."
"33713","Hamlet","39","2.2.183","LORD POLONIUS","Away, I do beseech you, both away:"
"33714","Hamlet","39","2.2.184","LORD POLONIUS","I'll board him presently."
"33715","Hamlet","39",,"LORD POLONIUS","Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants"
"33716","Hamlet","39",,"LORD POLONIUS","Enter HAMLET, reading"
"33717","Hamlet","39","2.2.185","LORD POLONIUS","O, give me leave:"
"33718","Hamlet","39","2.2.186","LORD POLONIUS","How does my good Lord Hamlet?"
"33719","Hamlet","40","2.2.187","HAMLET","Well, God-a-mercy."
"33720","Hamlet","41","2.2.188","LORD POLONIUS","Do you know me, my lord?"
"33721","Hamlet","42","2.2.189","HAMLET","Excellent well, you are a fishmonger."
"33722","Hamlet","43","2.2.190","LORD POLONIUS","Not I, my lord."
"33723","Hamlet","44","2.2.191","HAMLET","Then I would you were so honest a man."
"33724","Hamlet","45","2.2.192","LORD POLONIUS","Honest, my lord!"
"33725","Hamlet","46","2.2.193","HAMLET","Ay, sir, to be honest, as this world goes, is to be"
"33726","Hamlet","46","2.2.194","HAMLET","one man picked out of ten thousand."
"33727","Hamlet","47","2.2.195","LORD POLONIUS","That's very true, my lord."
"33728","Hamlet","48","2.2.196","HAMLET","For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a"
"33729","Hamlet","48","2.2.197","HAMLET","god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?"
"33730","Hamlet","49","2.2.198","LORD POLONIUS","I have, my lord."
"33731","Hamlet","50","2.2.199","HAMLET","Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a"
"33732","Hamlet","50","2.2.200","HAMLET","blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive."
"33733","Hamlet","50","2.2.201","HAMLET","Friend, look to 't."
"33734","Hamlet","51","2.2.202","LORD POLONIUS","[Aside]  How say you by that? Still harping on my"
"33735","Hamlet","51","2.2.203","LORD POLONIUS","daughter: yet he knew me not at first, he said I"
"33736","Hamlet","51","2.2.204","LORD POLONIUS","was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and"
"33737","Hamlet","51","2.2.205","LORD POLONIUS","truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for"
"33738","Hamlet","51","2.2.206","LORD POLONIUS","love, very near this. I'll speak to him again."
"33739","Hamlet","51","2.2.207","LORD POLONIUS","What do you read, my lord?"
"33740","Hamlet","52","2.2.208","HAMLET","Words, words, words."
"33741","Hamlet","53","2.2.209","LORD POLONIUS","What is the matter, my lord?"
"33742","Hamlet","54","2.2.210","HAMLET","Between who?"
"33743","Hamlet","55","2.2.211","LORD POLONIUS","I mean, the matter that you read, my lord."
"33744","Hamlet","56","2.2.212","HAMLET","Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here"
"33745","Hamlet","56","2.2.213","HAMLET","that old men have grey beards, that their faces are"
"33746","Hamlet","56","2.2.214","HAMLET","wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and"
"33747","Hamlet","56","2.2.215","HAMLET","plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of"
"33748","Hamlet","56","2.2.216","HAMLET","wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,"
"33749","Hamlet","56","2.2.217","HAMLET","though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet"
"33750","Hamlet","56","2.2.218","HAMLET","I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for"
"33751","Hamlet","56","2.2.219","HAMLET","yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab"
"33752","Hamlet","56","2.2.220","HAMLET","you could go backward."
"33753","Hamlet","57","2.2.221","LORD POLONIUS","[Aside]  Though this be madness, yet there is method"
"33754","Hamlet","57","2.2.222","LORD POLONIUS","in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?"
"33755","Hamlet","58","2.2.223","HAMLET","Into my grave."
"33756","Hamlet","59","2.2.224","LORD POLONIUS","Indeed, that is out o' the air."
"33757","Hamlet","59",,"LORD POLONIUS","Aside"
"33758","Hamlet","59","2.2.225","LORD POLONIUS","How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness"
"33759","Hamlet","59","2.2.226","LORD POLONIUS","that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity"
"33760","Hamlet","59","2.2.227","LORD POLONIUS","could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will"
"33761","Hamlet","59","2.2.228","LORD POLONIUS","leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of"
"33762","Hamlet","59","2.2.229","LORD POLONIUS","meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable"
"33763","Hamlet","59","2.2.230","LORD POLONIUS","lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you."
"33764","Hamlet","60","2.2.231","HAMLET","You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will"
"33765","Hamlet","60","2.2.232","HAMLET","more willingly part withal: except my life, except"
"33766","Hamlet","60","2.2.233","HAMLET","my life, except my life."
"33767","Hamlet","61","2.2.234","LORD POLONIUS","Fare you well, my lord."
"33768","Hamlet","62","2.2.235","HAMLET","These tedious old fools!"
"33769","Hamlet","62",,"HAMLET","Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN"
"33770","Hamlet","63","2.2.236","LORD POLONIUS","You go to seek the Lord Hamlet, there he is."
"33771","Hamlet","64","2.2.237","ROSENCRANTZ","[To POLONIUS]  God save you, sir!"
"33772","Hamlet","64",,"ROSENCRANTZ","Exit POLONIUS"
"33773","Hamlet","65","2.2.238","GUILDENSTERN","My honoured lord!"
"33774","Hamlet","66","2.2.239","ROSENCRANTZ","My most dear lord!"
"33775","Hamlet","67","2.2.240","HAMLET","My excellent good friends! How dost thou,"
"33776","Hamlet","67","2.2.241","HAMLET","Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?"
"33777","Hamlet","68","2.2.242","ROSENCRANTZ","As the indifferent children of the earth."
"33778","Hamlet","69","2.2.243","GUILDENSTERN","Happy, in that we are not over-happy,"
"33779","Hamlet","69","2.2.244","GUILDENSTERN","On fortune's cap we are not the very button."
"33780","Hamlet","70","2.2.245","HAMLET","Nor the soles of her shoe?"
"33781","Hamlet","71","2.2.246","ROSENCRANTZ","Neither, my lord."
"33782","Hamlet","72","2.2.247","HAMLET","Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of"
"33783","Hamlet","72","2.2.248","HAMLET","her favours?"
"33784","Hamlet","73","2.2.249","GUILDENSTERN","'Faith, her privates we."
"33785","Hamlet","74","2.2.250","HAMLET","In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true, she"
"33786","Hamlet","74","2.2.251","HAMLET","is a strumpet. What's the news?"
"33787","Hamlet","75","2.2.252","ROSENCRANTZ","None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest."
"33788","Hamlet","76","2.2.253","HAMLET","Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true."
"33789","Hamlet","76","2.2.254","HAMLET","Let me question more in particular: what have you,"
"33790","Hamlet","76","2.2.255","HAMLET","my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,"
"33791","Hamlet","76","2.2.256","HAMLET","that she sends you to prison hither?"
"33792","Hamlet","77","2.2.257","GUILDENSTERN","Prison, my lord!"
"33793","Hamlet","78","2.2.258","HAMLET","Denmark's a prison."
"33794","Hamlet","79","2.2.259","ROSENCRANTZ","Then is the world one."
"33795","Hamlet","80","2.2.260","HAMLET","A goodly one, in which there are many confines,"
"33796","Hamlet","80","2.2.261","HAMLET","wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst."
"33797","Hamlet","81","2.2.262","ROSENCRANTZ","We think not so, my lord."
"33798","Hamlet","82","2.2.263","HAMLET","Why, then, 'tis none to you, for there is nothing"
"33799","Hamlet","82","2.2.264","HAMLET","either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me"
"33800","Hamlet","82","2.2.265","HAMLET","it is a prison."
"33801","Hamlet","83","2.2.266","ROSENCRANTZ","Why then, your ambition makes it one, 'tis too"
"33802","Hamlet","83","2.2.267","ROSENCRANTZ","narrow for your mind."
"33803","Hamlet","84","2.2.268","HAMLET","O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count"
"33804","Hamlet","84","2.2.269","HAMLET","myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I"
"33805","Hamlet","84","2.2.270","HAMLET","have bad dreams."
"33806","Hamlet","85","2.2.271","GUILDENSTERN","Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very"
"33807","Hamlet","85","2.2.272","GUILDENSTERN","substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream."
"33808","Hamlet","86","2.2.273","HAMLET","A dream itself is but a shadow."
"33809","Hamlet","87","2.2.274","ROSENCRANTZ","Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a"
"33810","Hamlet","87","2.2.275","ROSENCRANTZ","quality that it is but a shadow's shadow."
"33811","Hamlet","88","2.2.276","HAMLET","Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and"
"33812","Hamlet","88","2.2.277","HAMLET","outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we"
"33813","Hamlet","88","2.2.278","HAMLET","to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason."
"33814","Hamlet","90","2.2.279","GUILDENSTERN","We'll wait upon you."
"33815","Hamlet","91","2.2.280","HAMLET","No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest"
"33816","Hamlet","91","2.2.281","HAMLET","of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest"
"33817","Hamlet","91","2.2.282","HAMLET","man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the"
"33818","Hamlet","91","2.2.283","HAMLET","beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?"
"33819","Hamlet","92","2.2.284","ROSENCRANTZ","To visit you, my lord, no other occasion."
"33820","Hamlet","93","2.2.285","HAMLET","Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks, but I"
"33821","Hamlet","93","2.2.286","HAMLET","thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are"
"33822","Hamlet","93","2.2.287","HAMLET","too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it"
"33823","Hamlet","93","2.2.288","HAMLET","your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,"
"33824","Hamlet","93","2.2.289","HAMLET","deal justly with me: come, come, nay, speak."
"33825","Hamlet","94","2.2.290","GUILDENSTERN","What should we say, my lord?"
"33826","Hamlet","95","2.2.291","HAMLET","Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent"
"33827","Hamlet","95","2.2.292","HAMLET","for, and there is a kind of confession in your looks"
"33828","Hamlet","95","2.2.293","HAMLET","which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:"
"33829","Hamlet","95","2.2.294","HAMLET","I know the good king and queen have sent for you."
"33830","Hamlet","96","2.2.295","ROSENCRANTZ","To what end, my lord?"
"33831","Hamlet","97","2.2.296","HAMLET","That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by"
"33832","Hamlet","97","2.2.297","HAMLET","the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of"
"33833","Hamlet","97","2.2.298","HAMLET","our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved"
"33834","Hamlet","97","2.2.299","HAMLET","love, and by what more dear a better proposer could"
"33835","Hamlet","97","2.2.300","HAMLET","charge you withal, be even and direct with me,"
"33836","Hamlet","97","2.2.301","HAMLET","whether you were sent for, or no?"
"33837","Hamlet","98","2.2.302","ROSENCRANTZ","[Aside to GUILDENSTERN]  What say you?"
"33838","Hamlet","99","2.2.303","HAMLET","[Aside]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you"
"33839","Hamlet","99","2.2.304","HAMLET","love me, hold not off."
"33840","Hamlet","100","2.2.305","GUILDENSTERN","My lord, we were sent for."

"35459","Hamlet","21","4.5.64","OPHELIA","By cock, they are to blame."
"35460","Hamlet","21","4.5.65","OPHELIA","Quoth she, before you tumbled me,"
"35461","Hamlet","21","4.5.66","OPHELIA","You promised me to wed."

"35476","Hamlet","24","4.5.79","KING CLAUDIUS","All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,"
"35477","Hamlet","24","4.5.80","KING CLAUDIUS","When sorrows come, they come not single spies"
"35478","Hamlet","24","4.5.81","KING CLAUDIUS","But in battalions. First, her father slain:"

"35480","Hamlet","24","4.5.83","KING CLAUDIUS","Of his own just remove: the people muddied,"
"35481","Hamlet","24","4.5.84","KING CLAUDIUS","Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,"
"35482","Hamlet","24","4.5.85","KING CLAUDIUS","For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly,"

"35498","Hamlet","26","4.5.100","KING CLAUDIUS","Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door."
"35499","Hamlet","26",,"KING CLAUDIUS","Enter another Gentleman"
"35500","Hamlet","26","4.5.101","KING CLAUDIUS","What is the matter?"
"35501","Hamlet","27","4.5.102","Gentleman","Save yourself, my lord:"
"35502","Hamlet","27","4.5.103","Gentleman","The ocean, overpeering of his list,"
"35503","Hamlet","27","4.5.104","Gentleman","Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste"
"35504","Hamlet","27","4.5.105","Gentleman","Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,"
"35505","Hamlet","27","4.5.106","Gentleman","O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord,"
"35506","Hamlet","27","4.5.107","Gentleman","And, as the world were now but to begin,"
"35507","Hamlet","27","4.5.108","Gentleman","Antiquity forgot, custom not known,"

"35523","Hamlet","34","4.5.121","LAERTES","Give me my father!"
"35524","Hamlet","35","4.5.122","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Calmly, good Laertes."

"35529","Hamlet","37","4.5.127","KING CLAUDIUS","What is the cause, Laertes,"
"35530","Hamlet","37","4.5.128","KING CLAUDIUS","That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?"
"35531","Hamlet","37","4.5.129","KING CLAUDIUS","Let him go, Gertrude, do not fear our person:"

"35694","Hamlet","3","4.7.13","KING CLAUDIUS","But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother"
"35695","Hamlet","3","4.7.14","KING CLAUDIUS","Lives almost by his looks, and for myself--"
"35696","Hamlet","3","4.7.15","KING CLAUDIUS","My virtue or my plague, be it either which--"
"35697","Hamlet","3","4.7.16","KING CLAUDIUS","She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,"
"35698","Hamlet","3","4.7.17","KING CLAUDIUS","That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,"
"35699","Hamlet","3","4.7.18","KING CLAUDIUS","I could not but by her. The other motive,"
"35700","Hamlet","3","4.7.19","KING CLAUDIUS","Why to a public count I might not go,"
"35701","Hamlet","3","4.7.20","KING CLAUDIUS","Is the great love the general gender bear him,"
"35702","Hamlet","3","4.7.21","KING CLAUDIUS","Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,"
"35703","Hamlet","3","4.7.22","KING CLAUDIUS","Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,"
"35704","Hamlet","3","4.7.23","KING CLAUDIUS","Convert his gyves to graces, so that my arrows,"
"35705","Hamlet","3","4.7.24","KING CLAUDIUS","Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,"
"35706","Hamlet","3","4.7.25","KING CLAUDIUS","Would have reverted to my bow again,"
"35707","Hamlet","3","4.7.26","KING CLAUDIUS","And not where I had aim'd them."
"35708","Hamlet","4","4.7.27","LAERTES","And so have I a noble father lost,"
"35709","Hamlet","4","4.7.28","LAERTES","A sister driven into desperate terms,"
"35710","Hamlet","4","4.7.29","LAERTES","Whose worth, if praises may go back again,"
"35711","Hamlet","4","4.7.30","LAERTES","Stood challenger on mount of all the age"
"35712","Hamlet","4","4.7.31","LAERTES","For her perfections: but my revenge will come."
"35713","Hamlet","5","4.7.32","KING CLAUDIUS","Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think"
"35714","Hamlet","5","4.7.33","KING CLAUDIUS","That we are made of stuff so flat and dull"
"35715","Hamlet","5","4.7.34","KING CLAUDIUS","That we can let our beard be shook with danger"
"35716","Hamlet","5","4.7.35","KING CLAUDIUS","And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:"
"35717","Hamlet","5","4.7.36","KING CLAUDIUS","I loved your father, and we love ourself,"
"35718","Hamlet","5","4.7.37","KING CLAUDIUS","And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--"
"35719","Hamlet","5",,"KING CLAUDIUS","Enter a Messenger"
"35720","Hamlet","5","4.7.38","KING CLAUDIUS","How now! what news?"
"35721","Hamlet","6","4.7.39","Messenger","Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:"
"35722","Hamlet","6","4.7.40","Messenger","This to your majesty, this to the queen."
"35723","Hamlet","7","4.7.41","KING CLAUDIUS","From Hamlet! who brought them?"
"35724","Hamlet","8","4.7.42","Messenger","Sailors, my lord, they say, I saw them not:"
"35725","Hamlet","8","4.7.43","Messenger","They were given me by Claudio, he received them"
"35726","Hamlet","8","4.7.44","Messenger","Of him that brought them."
"35727","Hamlet","9","4.7.45","KING CLAUDIUS","Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us."
"35728","Hamlet","9",,"KING CLAUDIUS","Exit Messenger"
"35729","Hamlet","9",,"KING CLAUDIUS","Reads"
"35730","Hamlet","9","4.7.46","KING CLAUDIUS","'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on"
"35731","Hamlet","9","4.7.47","KING CLAUDIUS","your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see"
"35732","Hamlet","9","4.7.48","KING CLAUDIUS","your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your"
"35733","Hamlet","9","4.7.49","KING CLAUDIUS","pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden"
"35734","Hamlet","9","4.7.50","KING CLAUDIUS","and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.'"
"35735","Hamlet","9","4.7.51","KING CLAUDIUS","What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?"
"35736","Hamlet","9","4.7.52","KING CLAUDIUS","Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?"
"35737","Hamlet","10","4.7.53","LAERTES","Know you the hand?"
"35738","Hamlet","11","4.7.54","KING CLAUDIUS","'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!"
"35739","Hamlet","11","4.7.55","KING CLAUDIUS","And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'"
"35740","Hamlet","11","4.7.56","KING CLAUDIUS","Can you advise me?"
"35741","Hamlet","12","4.7.57","LAERTES","I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come,"
"35742","Hamlet","12","4.7.58","LAERTES","It warms the very sickness in my heart,"
"35743","Hamlet","12","4.7.59","LAERTES","That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,"
"35744","Hamlet","12","4.7.60","LAERTES","'Thus didest thou.'"
"35745","Hamlet","13","4.7.61","KING CLAUDIUS","If it be so, Laertes--"
"35746","Hamlet","13","4.7.62","KING CLAUDIUS","As how should it be so? how otherwise?--"
"35747","Hamlet","13","4.7.63","KING CLAUDIUS","Will you be ruled by me?"
"35748","Hamlet","14","4.7.64","LAERTES","Ay, my lord,"
"35749","Hamlet","14","4.7.65","LAERTES","So you will not o'errule me to a peace."
"35750","Hamlet","15","4.7.66","KING CLAUDIUS","To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,"
"35751","Hamlet","15","4.7.67","KING CLAUDIUS","As checking at his voyage, and that he means"
"35752","Hamlet","15","4.7.68","KING CLAUDIUS","No more to undertake it, I will work him"
"35753","Hamlet","15","4.7.69","KING CLAUDIUS","To an exploit, now ripe in my device,"
"35754","Hamlet","15","4.7.70","KING CLAUDIUS","Under the which he shall not choose but fall:"
"35755","Hamlet","15","4.7.71","KING CLAUDIUS","And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,"
"35756","Hamlet","15","4.7.72","KING CLAUDIUS","But even his mother shall uncharge the practise"
"35757","Hamlet","15","4.7.73","KING CLAUDIUS","And call it accident."
"35758","Hamlet","16","4.7.74","LAERTES","My lord, I will be ruled,"
"35759","Hamlet","16","4.7.75","LAERTES","The rather, if you could devise it so"
"35760","Hamlet","16","4.7.76","LAERTES","That I might be the organ."
"35761","Hamlet","17","4.7.77","KING CLAUDIUS","It falls right."
"35762","Hamlet","17","4.7.78","KING CLAUDIUS","You have been talk'd of since your travel much,"
"35763","Hamlet","17","4.7.79","KING CLAUDIUS","And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality"
"35764","Hamlet","17","4.7.80","KING CLAUDIUS","Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts"
"35765","Hamlet","17","4.7.81","KING CLAUDIUS","Did not together pluck such envy from him"
"35766","Hamlet","17","4.7.82","KING CLAUDIUS","As did that one, and that, in my regard,"
"35767","Hamlet","17","4.7.83","KING CLAUDIUS","Of the unworthiest siege."
"35768","Hamlet","18","4.7.84","LAERTES","What part is that, my lord?"
"35769","Hamlet","19","4.7.85","KING CLAUDIUS","A very riband in the cap of youth,"
"35770","Hamlet","19","4.7.86","KING CLAUDIUS","Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes"
"35771","Hamlet","19","4.7.87","KING CLAUDIUS","The light and careless livery that it wears"
"35772","Hamlet","19","4.7.88","KING CLAUDIUS","Than settled age his sables and his weeds,"
"35773","Hamlet","19","4.7.89","KING CLAUDIUS","Importing health and graveness. Two months since,"
"35774","Hamlet","19","4.7.90","KING CLAUDIUS","Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--"
"35775","Hamlet","19","4.7.91","KING CLAUDIUS","I've seen myself, and served against, the French,"
"35776","Hamlet","19","4.7.92","KING CLAUDIUS","And they can well on horseback: but this gallant"
"35777","Hamlet","19","4.7.93","KING CLAUDIUS","Had witchcraft in't, he grew unto his seat,"
"35778","Hamlet","19","4.7.94","KING CLAUDIUS","And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,"
"35779","Hamlet","19","4.7.95","KING CLAUDIUS","As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured"
"35780","Hamlet","19","4.7.96","KING CLAUDIUS","With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,"
"35781","Hamlet","19","4.7.97","KING CLAUDIUS","That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,"
"35782","Hamlet","19","4.7.98","KING CLAUDIUS","Come short of what he did."
"35783","Hamlet","20","4.7.99","LAERTES","A Norman was't?"
"35784","Hamlet","21","4.7.100","KING CLAUDIUS","A Norman."
"35785","Hamlet","22","4.7.101","LAERTES","Upon my life, Lamond."
"35786","Hamlet","23","4.7.102","KING CLAUDIUS","The very same."
"35787","Hamlet","24","4.7.103","LAERTES","I know him well: he is the brooch indeed"
"35788","Hamlet","24","4.7.104","LAERTES","And gem of all the nation."
"35789","Hamlet","25","4.7.105","KING CLAUDIUS","He made confession of you,"
"35790","Hamlet","25","4.7.106","KING CLAUDIUS","And gave you such a masterly report"
"35791","Hamlet","25","4.7.107","KING CLAUDIUS","For art and exercise in your defence"
"35792","Hamlet","25","4.7.108","KING CLAUDIUS","And for your rapier most especially,"
"35793","Hamlet","25","4.7.109","KING CLAUDIUS","That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,"
"35794","Hamlet","25","4.7.110","KING CLAUDIUS","If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,"
"35795","Hamlet","25","4.7.111","KING CLAUDIUS","He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,"
"35796","Hamlet","25","4.7.112","KING CLAUDIUS","If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his"
"35797","Hamlet","25","4.7.113","KING CLAUDIUS","Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy"
"35798","Hamlet","25","4.7.114","KING CLAUDIUS","That he could nothing do but wish and beg"
"35799","Hamlet","25","4.7.115","KING CLAUDIUS","Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him."
"35800","Hamlet","25","4.7.116","KING CLAUDIUS","Now, out of this,--"
"35801","Hamlet","26","4.7.117","LAERTES","What out of this, my lord?"
"35802","Hamlet","27","4.7.118","KING CLAUDIUS","Laertes, was your father dear to you?"
"35803","Hamlet","27","4.7.119","KING CLAUDIUS","Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,"
"35804","Hamlet","27","4.7.120","KING CLAUDIUS","A face without a heart?"
"35805","Hamlet","28","4.7.121","LAERTES","Why ask you this?"
"35806","Hamlet","29","4.7.122","KING CLAUDIUS","Not that I think you did not love your father,"
"35807","Hamlet","29","4.7.123","KING CLAUDIUS","But that I know love is begun by time,"
"35808","Hamlet","29","4.7.124","KING CLAUDIUS","And that I see, in passages of proof,"
"35809","Hamlet","29","4.7.125","KING CLAUDIUS","Time qualifies the spark and fire of it."
"35810","Hamlet","29","4.7.126","KING CLAUDIUS","There lives within the very flame of love"
"35811","Hamlet","29","4.7.127","KING CLAUDIUS","A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it,"
"35812","Hamlet","29","4.7.128","KING CLAUDIUS","And nothing is at a like goodness still,"
"35813","Hamlet","29","4.7.129","KING CLAUDIUS","For goodness, growing to a plurisy,"
"35814","Hamlet","29","4.7.130","KING CLAUDIUS","Dies in his own too much: that we would do"
"35815","Hamlet","29","4.7.131","KING CLAUDIUS","We should do when we would, for this 'would' changes"
"35816","Hamlet","29","4.7.132","KING CLAUDIUS","And hath abatements and delays as many"
"35817","Hamlet","29","4.7.133","KING CLAUDIUS","As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents,"
"35818","Hamlet","29","4.7.134","KING CLAUDIUS","And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,"
"35819","Hamlet","29","4.7.135","KING CLAUDIUS","That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--"
"35820","Hamlet","29","4.7.136","KING CLAUDIUS","Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,"
"35821","Hamlet","29","4.7.137","KING CLAUDIUS","To show yourself your father's son in deed"
"35822","Hamlet","29","4.7.138","KING CLAUDIUS","More than in words?"
"35823","Hamlet","30","4.7.139","LAERTES","To cut his throat i' the church."
"35824","Hamlet","31","4.7.140","KING CLAUDIUS","No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize,"
"35825","Hamlet","31","4.7.141","KING CLAUDIUS","Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,"
"35826","Hamlet","31","4.7.142","KING CLAUDIUS","Will you do this, keep close within your chamber."
"35827","Hamlet","31","4.7.143","KING CLAUDIUS","Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:"
"35828","Hamlet","31","4.7.144","KING CLAUDIUS","We'll put on those shall praise your excellence"
"35829","Hamlet","31","4.7.145","KING CLAUDIUS","And set a double varnish on the fame"
"35830","Hamlet","31","4.7.146","KING CLAUDIUS","The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together"
"35831","Hamlet","31","4.7.147","KING CLAUDIUS","And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,"
"35832","Hamlet","31","4.7.148","KING CLAUDIUS","Most generous and free from all contriving,"
"35833","Hamlet","31","4.7.149","KING CLAUDIUS","Will not peruse the foils, so that, with ease,"
"35834","Hamlet","31","4.7.150","KING CLAUDIUS","Or with a little shuffling, you may choose"
"35835","Hamlet","31","4.7.151","KING CLAUDIUS","A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise"
"35836","Hamlet","31","4.7.152","KING CLAUDIUS","Requite him for your father."
"35837","Hamlet","32","4.7.153","LAERTES","I will do't:"
"35838","Hamlet","32","4.7.154","LAERTES","And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword."
"35839","Hamlet","32","4.7.155","LAERTES","I bought an unction of a mountebank,"
"35840","Hamlet","32","4.7.156","LAERTES","So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,"
"35841","Hamlet","32","4.7.157","LAERTES","Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,"
"35842","Hamlet","32","4.7.158","LAERTES","Collected from all simples that have virtue"
"35843","Hamlet","32","4.7.159","LAERTES","Under the moon, can save the thing from death"
"35844","Hamlet","32","4.7.160","LAERTES","That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point"
"35845","Hamlet","32","4.7.161","LAERTES","With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,"
"35846","Hamlet","32","4.7.162","LAERTES","It may be death."
"35847","Hamlet","33","4.7.163","KING CLAUDIUS","Let's further think of this,"
"35848","Hamlet","33","4.7.164","KING CLAUDIUS","Weigh what convenience both of time and means"
"35849","Hamlet","33","4.7.165","KING CLAUDIUS","May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,"
"35850","Hamlet","33","4.7.166","KING CLAUDIUS","And that our drift look through our bad performance,"
"35851","Hamlet","33","4.7.167","KING CLAUDIUS","'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project"
"35852","Hamlet","33","4.7.168","KING CLAUDIUS","Should have a back or second, that might hold,"
"35853","Hamlet","33","4.7.169","KING CLAUDIUS","If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:"
"35854","Hamlet","33","4.7.170","KING CLAUDIUS","We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't."
"35855","Hamlet","33","4.7.171","KING CLAUDIUS","When in your motion you are hot and dry--"
"35856","Hamlet","33","4.7.172","KING CLAUDIUS","As make your bouts more violent to that end--"
"35857","Hamlet","33","4.7.173","KING CLAUDIUS","And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him"
"35858","Hamlet","33","4.7.174","KING CLAUDIUS","A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,"
"35859","Hamlet","33","4.7.175","KING CLAUDIUS","If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,"
"35860","Hamlet","33","4.7.176","KING CLAUDIUS","Our purpose may hold there."
"35861","Hamlet","33",,"KING CLAUDIUS","Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE"
"35862","Hamlet","33","4.7.177","KING CLAUDIUS","How now, sweet queen!"
"35863","Hamlet","34","4.7.178","QUEEN GERTRUDE","One woe doth tread upon another's heel,"
"35864","Hamlet","34","4.7.179","QUEEN GERTRUDE","So fast they follow, your sister's drown'd, Laertes."
"35865","Hamlet","35","4.7.180","LAERTES","Drown'd! O, where?"
"35866","Hamlet","36","4.7.181","QUEEN GERTRUDE","There is a willow grows aslant a brook,"
"35867","Hamlet","36","4.7.182","QUEEN GERTRUDE","That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream,"
"35868","Hamlet","36","4.7.183","QUEEN GERTRUDE","There with fantastic garlands did she come"
"35869","Hamlet","36","4.7.184","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples"
"35870","Hamlet","36","4.7.185","QUEEN GERTRUDE","That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,"
"35871","Hamlet","36","4.7.186","QUEEN GERTRUDE","But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:"
"35872","Hamlet","36","4.7.187","QUEEN GERTRUDE","There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds"
"35873","Hamlet","36","4.7.188","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke,"
"35874","Hamlet","36","4.7.189","QUEEN GERTRUDE","When down her weedy trophies and herself"
"35875","Hamlet","36","4.7.190","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,"
"35876","Hamlet","36","4.7.191","QUEEN GERTRUDE","And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:"
"35877","Hamlet","36","4.7.192","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes,"
"35878","Hamlet","36","4.7.193","QUEEN GERTRUDE","As one incapable of her own distress,"
"35879","Hamlet","36","4.7.194","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Or like a creature native and indued"
"35880","Hamlet","36","4.7.195","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Unto that element: but long it could not be"
"35881","Hamlet","36","4.7.196","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,"
"35882","Hamlet","36","4.7.197","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay"
"35883","Hamlet","36","4.7.198","QUEEN GERTRUDE","To muddy death."
"35884","Hamlet","37","4.7.199","LAERTES","Alas, then, she is drown'd?"
"35885","Hamlet","38","4.7.200","QUEEN GERTRUDE","Drown'd, drown'd."
"35886","Hamlet","39","4.7.201","LAERTES","Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,"
"35887","Hamlet","39","4.7.202","LAERTES","And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet"
"35888","Hamlet","39","4.7.203","LAERTES","It is our trick, nature her custom holds,"
"35889","Hamlet","39","4.7.204","LAERTES","Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,"
"35890","Hamlet","39","4.7.205","LAERTES","The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:"
"35891","Hamlet","39","4.7.206","LAERTES","I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,"
"35892","Hamlet","39","4.7.207","LAERTES","But that this folly douts it."
"35893","Hamlet","39",,"LAERTES","Exit"
"35894","Hamlet","40","4.7.208","KING CLAUDIUS","Let's follow, Gertrude:"
"35895","Hamlet","40","4.7.209","KING CLAUDIUS","How much I had to do to calm his rage!"
"35896","Hamlet","40","4.7.210","KING CLAUDIUS","Now fear I this will give it start again,"

"35904","Hamlet","2","5.1.3","Second Clown","I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave"
"35905","Hamlet","2","5.1.4","Second Clown","straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it"
"35906","Hamlet","2","5.1.5","Second Clown","Christian burial."

"35909","Hamlet","4","5.1.8","Second Clown","Why, 'tis found so."
"35910","Hamlet","5","5.1.9","First Clown","It must be 'se offendendo,' it cannot be else. For"
"35911","Hamlet","5","5.1.10","First Clown","here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,"
"35912","Hamlet","5","5.1.11","First Clown","it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it"
"35913","Hamlet","5","5.1.12","First Clown","is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned"
"35914","Hamlet","5","5.1.13","First Clown","herself wittingly."
"35915","Hamlet","6","5.1.14","Second Clown","Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--"
"35916","Hamlet","7","5.1.15","First Clown","Give me leave. Here lies the water, good: here"
"35917","Hamlet","7","5.1.16","First Clown","stands the man, good, if the man go to this water,"
"35918","Hamlet","7","5.1.17","First Clown","and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he"
"35919","Hamlet","7","5.1.18","First Clown","goes,--mark you that, but if the water come to him"

"36233","Hamlet","3","5.2.4","HAMLET","Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,"
"36234","Hamlet","3","5.2.5","HAMLET","That would not let me sleep: methought I lay"
"36235","Hamlet","3","5.2.6","HAMLET","Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,"

"36248","Hamlet","5","5.2.19","HAMLET","Their grand commission, where I found, Horatio,--"
"36249","Hamlet","5","5.2.20","HAMLET","O royal knavery!--an exact command,"
"36250","Hamlet","5","5.2.21","HAMLET","Larded with many several sorts of reasons"
"36251","Hamlet","5","5.2.22","HAMLET","Importing Denmark's health and England's too,"
"36252","Hamlet","5","5.2.23","HAMLET","With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,"
"36253","Hamlet","5","5.2.24","HAMLET","That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,"
"36254","Hamlet","5","5.2.25","HAMLET","No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,"
"36255","Hamlet","5","5.2.26","HAMLET","My head should be struck off."
"36256","Hamlet","6","5.2.27","HORATIO","Is't possible?"
"36257","Hamlet","7","5.2.28","HAMLET","Here's the commission: read it at more leisure."
"36258","Hamlet","7","5.2.29","HAMLET","But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?"

"36263","Hamlet","9","5.2.34","HAMLET","Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:"
"36264","Hamlet","9","5.2.35","HAMLET","I once did hold it, as our statists do,"
"36265","Hamlet","9","5.2.36","HAMLET","A baseness to write fair and labour'd much"
"36266","Hamlet","9","5.2.37","HAMLET","How to forget that learning, but, sir, now"
"36267","Hamlet","9","5.2.38","HAMLET","It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know"

"36269","Hamlet","10","5.2.40","HORATIO","Ay, good my lord."
"36270","Hamlet","11","5.2.41","HAMLET","An earnest conjuration from the king,"
"36271","Hamlet","11","5.2.42","HAMLET","As England was his faithful tributary,"
"36272","Hamlet","11","5.2.43","HAMLET","As love between them like the palm might flourish,"

"36278","Hamlet","11","5.2.49","HAMLET","He should the bearers put to sudden death,"
"36279","Hamlet","11","5.2.50","HAMLET","Not shriving-time allow'd."
"36280","Hamlet","12","5.2.51","HORATIO","How was this seal'd?"
"36281","Hamlet","13","5.2.52","HAMLET","Why, even in that was heaven ordinant."
"36282","Hamlet","13","5.2.53","HAMLET","I had my father's signet in my purse,"
"36283","Hamlet","13","5.2.54","HAMLET","Which was the model of that Danish seal,"
"36284","Hamlet","13","5.2.55","HAMLET","Folded the writ up in form of the other,"
"36285","Hamlet","13","5.2.56","HAMLET","Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,"
"36286","Hamlet","13","5.2.57","HAMLET","The changeling never known. Now, the next day"
"36287","Hamlet","13","5.2.58","HAMLET","Was our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent"
"36288","Hamlet","13","5.2.59","HAMLET","Thou know'st already."
"36289","Hamlet","14","5.2.60","HORATIO","So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't."
"36290","Hamlet","15","5.2.61","HAMLET","Why, man, they did make love to this employment,"
"36291","Hamlet","15","5.2.62","HAMLET","They are not near my conscience, their defeat"
"36292","Hamlet","15","5.2.63","HAMLET","Does by their own insinuation grow:"
"36293","Hamlet","15","5.2.64","HAMLET","'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes"
"36294","Hamlet","15","5.2.65","HAMLET","Between the pass and fell incensed points"
"36295","Hamlet","15","5.2.66","HAMLET","Of mighty opposites."
"36296","Hamlet","16","5.2.67","HORATIO","Why, what a king is this!"
"36297","Hamlet","17","5.2.68","HAMLET","Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--"
"36298","Hamlet","17","5.2.69","HAMLET","He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,"
"36299","Hamlet","17","5.2.70","HAMLET","Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,"
"36300","Hamlet","17","5.2.71","HAMLET","Thrown out his angle for my proper life,"
"36301","Hamlet","17","5.2.72","HAMLET","And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,"
"36302","Hamlet","17","5.2.73","HAMLET","To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,"
"36303","Hamlet","17","5.2.74","HAMLET","To let this canker of our nature come"
"36304","Hamlet","17","5.2.75","HAMLET","In further evil?"
"36305","Hamlet","18","5.2.76","HORATIO","It must be shortly known to him from England"
"36306","Hamlet","18","5.2.77","HORATIO","What is the issue of the business there."
"36307","Hamlet","19","5.2.78","HAMLET","It will be short: the interim is mine,"
"36308","Hamlet","19","5.2.79","HAMLET","And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'"
"36309","Hamlet","19","5.2.80","HAMLET","But I am very sorry, good Horatio,"
"36310","Hamlet","19","5.2.81","HAMLET","That to Laertes I forgot myself,"
"36311","Hamlet","19","5.2.82","HAMLET","For, by the image of my cause, I see"
"36312","Hamlet","19","5.2.83","HAMLET","The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours."
"36313","Hamlet","19","5.2.84","HAMLET","But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me"
"36314","Hamlet","19","5.2.85","HAMLET","Into a towering passion."
"36315","Hamlet","20","5.2.86","HORATIO","Peace! who comes here?"
"36316","Hamlet","20",,"HORATIO","Enter OSRIC"

"36319","Hamlet","23","5.2.89","HORATIO","No, my good lord."
"36320","Hamlet","24","5.2.90","HAMLET","Thy state is the more gracious, for 'tis a vice to"

"36324","Hamlet","24","5.2.94","HAMLET","spacious in the possession of dirt."
"36325","Hamlet","25","5.2.95","OSRIC","Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I"
"36326","Hamlet","25","5.2.96","OSRIC","should impart a thing to you from his majesty."
"36327","Hamlet","26","5.2.97","HAMLET","I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of"

"36329","Hamlet","27","5.2.99","OSRIC","I thank your lordship, it is very hot."
"36330","Hamlet","28","5.2.100","HAMLET","No, believe me, 'tis very cold, the wind is"

"36332","Hamlet","29","5.2.102","OSRIC","It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed."
"36333","Hamlet","30","5.2.103","HAMLET","But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my"

"36341","Hamlet","33","5.2.110","OSRIC","Nay, good my lord, for mine ease, in good faith."
"36342","Hamlet","33","5.2.111","OSRIC","Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes, believe"
"36343","Hamlet","33","5.2.112","OSRIC","me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent"
"36344","Hamlet","33","5.2.113","OSRIC","differences, of very soft society and great showing:"
"36345","Hamlet","33","5.2.114","OSRIC","indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or"
"36346","Hamlet","33","5.2.115","OSRIC","calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the"
"36347","Hamlet","33","5.2.116","OSRIC","continent of what part a gentleman would see."
"36348","Hamlet","34","5.2.117","HAMLET","Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you,"
"36349","Hamlet","34","5.2.118","HAMLET","though, I know, to divide him inventorially would"

"36351","Hamlet","34","5.2.120","HAMLET","neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the"
"36352","Hamlet","34","5.2.121","HAMLET","verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of"
"36353","Hamlet","34","5.2.122","HAMLET","great article, and his infusion of such dearth and"
"36354","Hamlet","34","5.2.123","HAMLET","rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his"
"36355","Hamlet","34","5.2.124","HAMLET","semblable is his mirror, and who else would trace"
"36356","Hamlet","34","5.2.125","HAMLET","him, his umbrage, nothing more."
"36357","Hamlet","35","5.2.126","OSRIC","Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him."

"36360","Hamlet","37","5.2.129","OSRIC","Sir?"
"36361","Hamlet","38","5.2.130","HORATIO","Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?"
"36362","Hamlet","38","5.2.131","HORATIO","You will do't, sir, really."
"36363","Hamlet","39","5.2.132","HAMLET","What imports the nomination of this gentleman?"
"36364","Hamlet","40","5.2.133","OSRIC","Of Laertes?"
"36365","Hamlet","41","5.2.134","HORATIO","His purse is empty already, all's golden words are spent."
"36366","Hamlet","42","5.2.135","HAMLET","Of him, sir."
"36367","Hamlet","43","5.2.136","OSRIC","I know you are not ignorant--"

"36369","Hamlet","44","5.2.138","HAMLET","it would not much approve me. Well, sir?"
"36370","Hamlet","45","5.2.139","OSRIC","You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--"
"36371","Hamlet","46","5.2.140","HAMLET","I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with"
"36372","Hamlet","46","5.2.141","HAMLET","him in excellence, but, to know a man well, were to"
"36373","Hamlet","46","5.2.142","HAMLET","know himself."
"36374","Hamlet","47","5.2.143","OSRIC","I mean, sir, for his weapon, but in the imputation"

"36376","Hamlet","48","5.2.145","HAMLET","What's his weapon?"
"36377","Hamlet","49","5.2.146","OSRIC","Rapier and dagger."
"36378","Hamlet","50","5.2.147","HAMLET","That's two of his weapons: but, well."
"36379","Hamlet","51","5.2.148","OSRIC","The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary"
"36380","Hamlet","51","5.2.149","OSRIC","horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take"

"36385","Hamlet","51","5.2.154","OSRIC","and of very liberal conceit."

"36617","Hamlet","138","5.2.369","HAMLET","The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:"
"36618","Hamlet","138","5.2.370","HAMLET","I cannot live to hear the news from England,"
"36619","Hamlet","138","5.2.371","HAMLET","But I do prophesy the election lights"
"36620","Hamlet","138","5.2.372","HAMLET","On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice,"
"36621","Hamlet","138","5.2.373","HAMLET","So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,"
"36622","Hamlet","138","5.2.374","HAMLET","Which have solicited. The rest is silence."
"36623","Hamlet","138",,"HAMLET","Dies"
"36624","Hamlet","139","5.2.375","HORATIO","Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:"
"36625","Hamlet","139","5.2.376","HORATIO","And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!"
"36626","Hamlet","139","5.2.377","HORATIO","Why does the drum come hither?"
"36627","Hamlet","139",,"HORATIO","March within"
"36628","Hamlet","139",,"HORATIO","Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others"
"36629","Hamlet","140","5.2.378","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","Where is this sight?"
"36630","Hamlet","141","5.2.379","HORATIO","What is it ye would see?"
"36631","Hamlet","141","5.2.380","HORATIO","If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search."
"36632","Hamlet","142","5.2.381","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,"
"36633","Hamlet","142","5.2.382","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,"
"36634","Hamlet","142","5.2.383","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","That thou so many princes at a shot"
"36635","Hamlet","142","5.2.384","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","So bloodily hast struck?"
"36636","Hamlet","143","5.2.385","First Ambassador","The sight is dismal,"
"36637","Hamlet","143","5.2.386","First Ambassador","And our affairs from England come too late:"
"36638","Hamlet","143","5.2.387","First Ambassador","The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,"
"36639","Hamlet","143","5.2.388","First Ambassador","To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,"
"36640","Hamlet","143","5.2.389","First Ambassador","That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:"
"36641","Hamlet","143","5.2.390","First Ambassador","Where should we have our thanks?"
"36642","Hamlet","144","5.2.391","HORATIO","Not from his mouth,"
"36643","Hamlet","144","5.2.392","HORATIO","Had it the ability of life to thank you:"
"36644","Hamlet","144","5.2.393","HORATIO","He never gave commandment for their death."
"36645","Hamlet","144","5.2.394","HORATIO","But since, so jump upon this bloody question,"
"36646","Hamlet","144","5.2.395","HORATIO","You from the Polack wars, and you from England,"
"36647","Hamlet","144","5.2.396","HORATIO","Are here arrived give order that these bodies"
"36648","Hamlet","144","5.2.397","HORATIO","High on a stage be placed to the view,"
"36649","Hamlet","144","5.2.398","HORATIO","And let me speak to the yet unknowing world"
"36650","Hamlet","144","5.2.399","HORATIO","How these things came about: so shall you hear"
"36651","Hamlet","144","5.2.400","HORATIO","Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,"
"36652","Hamlet","144","5.2.401","HORATIO","Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,"
"36653","Hamlet","144","5.2.402","HORATIO","Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,"
"36654","Hamlet","144","5.2.403","HORATIO","And, in this upshot, purposes mistook"
"36655","Hamlet","144","5.2.404","HORATIO","Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I"
"36656","Hamlet","144","5.2.405","HORATIO","Truly deliver."
"36657","Hamlet","145","5.2.406","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","Let us haste to hear it,"
"36658","Hamlet","145","5.2.407","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","And call the noblest to the audience."
"36659","Hamlet","145","5.2.408","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:"
"36660","Hamlet","145","5.2.409","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,"
"36661","Hamlet","145","5.2.410","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me."
"36662","Hamlet","146","5.2.411","HORATIO","Of that I shall have also cause to speak,"
"36663","Hamlet","146","5.2.412","HORATIO","And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more,"
"36664","Hamlet","146","5.2.413","HORATIO","But let this same be presently perform'd,"
"36665","Hamlet","146","5.2.414","HORATIO","Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance"
"36666","Hamlet","146","5.2.415","HORATIO","On plots and errors, happen."
"36667","Hamlet","147","5.2.416","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","Let four captains"
"36668","Hamlet","147","5.2.417","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage,"
"36669","Hamlet","147","5.2.418","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","For he was likely, had he been put on,"
"36670","Hamlet","147","5.2.419","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,"
"36671","Hamlet","147","5.2.420","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","The soldiers' music and the rites of war"
"36672","Hamlet","147","5.2.421","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","Speak loudly for him."
"36673","Hamlet","147","5.2.422","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","Take up the bodies: such a sight as this"
"36674","Hamlet","147","5.2.423","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss."
"36675","Hamlet","147","5.2.424","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","Go, bid the soldiers shoot."
"36676","Hamlet","147","5.2.424","PRINCE FORTINBRAS","A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies, after which a peal of ordnance is shot off"
